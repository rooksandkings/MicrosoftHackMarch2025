The first decade of the 2000s saw the further democratization of trading due to increased access through technology, and the past decade has seen the convergence of banking and investing and the rise of fee-based managed accounts. These seismic shifts raise the question of what the next decade will bring--and how we might describe the 2020s from the perspective of 2030.

First, a glance backward: according to McKinsey research, in 2000, the North American wealth-management industry totaled $13 trillion in client assets. In the next ten years, client assets grew approximately 45 percent, reaching $19 trillion, with a profit margin of 16 basis points in 2010. There were about 420,000 advisers in the United States and Canada in 2010. By 2018, client assets rose 64 percent compared to 2010, reaching about $30.5 trillion, and margins improved to 18 basis points. While the total number of advisers remained largely unchanged, the adviser workforce aged materially; in the United States, only 25 percent were under the age of 44, compared to 33 percent in 2010.

This evolution occurred against a backdrop of more fundamental changes in the economy. In the past ten years, global data volume also skyrocketed--from two zettabytes in 2010 to 41 zettabytes in 2019 (a zettabyte is one sextillion bytes). Internet users globally doubled to roughly four billion, and monthly active Facebook users grew from 370 million in 2010 to about 1.6 billion in 2019.

Now, looking ahead, we expect the wealth-management industry to significantly evolve again, along the following lines:

These trends and others will lead to a meaningfully different wealth-management industry by 2030.

In the next ten years, the nature of advice and the way it is delivered and consumed will fundamentally change.

In 2030, up to 80 percent of new wealth-management clients will want to access advice in a Netflix-style model--that is, data-driven, hyper-personalized, continuous, and, potentially, by subscription.

The emergence of a tailored and personalized model underpinned by data can be observed across industries but is perhaps most prevalent in entertainment--in the shift from physical music recordings to unlimited streaming of digital music, or from seeing films in movie theatres to streaming them at home--or anywhere. The streaming giants are using customer data to continuously and deeply understand preferences and develop hyper-personalized recommendations.

For wealth managers, continuous access and automatic hyper-personalization could change the terms of success. Advisers can embark on the journey now by using data and technology on a more frequent and consistent basis.

Advice will also be refocused. By 2030, at least 80 percent of advisers will offer goal-based advice, and about half of clients will actively pursue and track bite-sized goals (such as saving for three college credits a month)--and this granular goal tracking will span customers' investment, protection, education, retirement, and broader wellness.

Despite the recent progress made by goal-based advice, only 39 percent of affluent consumers have a written financial plan. Furthermore, success in goal-based advice will also require a dedicated approach to modifying client behaviors and mind-sets to help them achieve their goals. To bring goal-based advice to life and make it practical, intuitive, and actionable, advisers need to leverage behavioral-economics techniques such as gamification and community-based competitive measures.

Outside of wealth management, the success of goal-based methodologies can be seen in the skyrocketing growth of fitness-tracking devices, which first showcased the psychological power of breaking down large goals, subsequent daily monitoring and tracking, and the importance of validation and feedback. Discovery, a South African financial-services provider, launched a behavioral-change program called Vitality. The program incentivizes customers to set goals, make healthier choices, track their progress, and gain status in the community, and it dynamically rewards them for reducing their risk through insurance-premium reductions and other benefits such as discounts on cars and flights.

By 2030, we believe that all successful wealth managers will develop services that help their clients dynamically monitor, adjust, and achieve their goals.

Leading big tech-ecosystem players have emerged as the core infrastructure providers of the wealth-management industry, accruing significant economics through their analytics and cloud-services offerings. The clout of the big tech-infrastructure providers will only grow over time. Furthermore, barring regulatory hurdles, they could become direct competitors and ultimately vastly increase pricing transparency and ease of access.

So far, big tech firms have participated in the wealth-management industry largely through the provision of cloud-computing services, which have become a core part of the infrastructure of many wealth-management firms. For example, auto-scaling capabilities offered by cloud-computing service providers ensure website stability during days of market turbulence and peak traffic by ""spinning up"" additional capacity. This is one example of how big tech firms are quickly becoming leading ""infrastructure"" providers for the wealth-management industry and, in the process, extracting a greater share of the industry's profit pool. In the next ten years, the wealth-management value chain will likely consolidate around a set of infrastructure providers who will capture a significantly larger portion of the industry's economics. In this future state, wealth managers will rent larger portions of their value chain from third parties and their ability to manage these relationships will be strategically differentiating.

It remains to be seen whether ""ecosystem"" big-tech firms--which own end-customer relationships and offer an interconnected set of services--have ambitions to enter the advice space itself or whether they are content to remain service providers to the industry. If they do enter, they have customer, technological, and capital advantages that could meaningfully distinguish them from incumbents. Amazon, for example, has more than 100 million Prime households in the United States (roughly 82 percent penetration)--that is a lot of touchpoints.

One potential ""future"" can be seen in China, where Tencent, which offers a host of financial services, including lending and payments, acquired a license to sell mutual funds through their chat app WeChat in January 2018. Previously they had only been able to act as a platform through which third-party fund companies could sell their products. Currently, the regulatory environment in the United States may be a barrier to entry for big tech firms seeking to get deeper into advice. Over time, however, this could change.

As the nature of advice and the way it is accessed and consumed shift, advisers will need keep up with the changes.

Imagine a world where half of advisers across channels in 2030 are women, up from about 33 percent today, according to McKinsey research (in private banks the figure is closer to 45 percent today); 40 percent are minorities, up from roughly 20 percent today; and 50 percent are mid-career in tenure (30 to 40 years old), up from about 25 percent today. The approach to recruiting and talent sources will need to fundamentally change to realize a different mix in our adviser forces.

As women, minorities, Gen Xers, and millennials comprise higher shares of the client base, wealth management will see the rise of advisers who speak their clients' ""language,"" who know how to garner their trust and are more digitally savvy.

While women will soon control the majority of the assets in the United States, no wealth manager is known to have cracked the code on serving women through new and differentiated value propositions thus far. In the coming decade, it is likely that an incumbent or newcomer will figure out how to appeal to this segment and meet their needs and preferences and, in turn, achieve disproportionate organic growth.

More broadly, it is clear that firms will need to reflect the communities they serve.

By 2030, as advice becomes increasingly analytics-driven and automated, advisers will shift their focus to comprehensive planning beyond the portfolio. As a result, the number of advisers will drop by up to a fifth. This will also be driven in part by the natural retirement of advisers--Cerulli forecasts, for example, that over the next five years about 7,000 ""traditional"" advisers will retire.

Today, many advisers offer some kind of financial planning (the percentage of clients who actually use the service varies greatly by adviser and by firm). In fact, there are about 80,000 certified financial planners in the United States, some of whom are part of a larger financial adviser's team. We believe advisers in the next decade will require a different set of skills tailored to client needs. This shift will also be fueled by the proliferation of the hyper-personalized advice model and the emphasis on bite-size goals.

In the next ten years, advisers will gradually shed their role as investment managers and become more like integrated life/wealth coaches who advise clients on investments, banking, healthcare, protection, taxes, estate, and financial wellness needs more broadly. As the industry undergoes this shift, wealth managers will need to fundamentally rethink their recruiting strategies and training programs.

By 2030, clients will join community forums to rate and review advisers, especially as advice becomes more democratized.

To date, an adviser's reputation has been largely shaped by word of mouth; no systematic, transparent form of adviser ratings or reviews exists. This is bound to change as the bar for customer experience is set by industries outside of financial services, information availability increases, and data sharing continues to grow in relevance.

Transparent, community-based ratings and reviews are common in other industries. Ridesharing drivers have ratings and reviews, coupled with highlights of their track record (for example, number of rides they have given, and percent of five-star rides). Doctors are rated and reviewed on platforms such as Zocdoc and Opencare--which are particularly influential given that patients increasingly choose doctors and make appointments online. The transparency and community-based nature of these reviews tend to encourage superior performance and customer outcomes in these industries--as they will in wealth management.

The emergence of transparency and user ratings on adviser performance may lead to a decline in client stickiness; as information and alternatives abound, clients may more readily switch between advisers--although these same trends could encourage better adviser performance that helps retain clients.

As customer preferences shift and as advisers adapt, wealth-management firms will need to make strategic choices and determine where and how they will play in the next ten years.

By 2030, wealth managers will leverage data and advanced analytics in every aspect of their business, both client-facing and non-client-facing, and this shift will change the type of talent they will need to succeed.

A compelling example from China is Lufax, the Ping An-backed online wealth-management platform that engages customers purely through its mobile app. Lufax leverages its wealth of behavioral data in every aspect of its business--from deploying advanced analytics to understand customers' needs and risk appetite and projecting their future investment paths, to leveraging big data to create dynamic and detailed ""profiles"" of each of its 5,000 investment products, including information on underlying assets, fund-manager identity, skills, and style, and using artificial intelligence to match these products with individual customers based on their shifting needs.

As data increasingly become the ""raw material"" for success, financial-services providers need to behave and function like tech firms. In recent years, banks have been competing with the likes of Google and Facebook for tech talent. The same will be true for wealth managers as they seek to meet customers' digital demands, make data-driven, artificial-intelligence (AI)-enabled investment decisions, and improve operational effectiveness.

In the coming decade, the number of clients served by wealth managers will grow at unprecedented rates as lower-cost solutions penetrate historically underserved segments. To serve these clients profitably in an evolving environment in which entire revenue pools can disappear (for example, online trading commissions), wealth managers will need to turbocharge their operational excellence to defend their profit pools.

We anticipate that in order to profitably serve new customers, firms will need to be radically leaner than they are today and set a rising bar for operational excellence. They will need to use technologies like AI and robotics to reshape economics and reduce more than half of administrative work, allowing them to remain profitable in an era of greater fee transparency and lower fees.

Most US and Canadian wealth managers have struggled to fully deploy some of the recent milestone developments in technology--robotic process automation, smart workflows, machine learning, advanced analytics, natural-language processing, and cognitive agents. Front-end digitization in wealth management has been lagging behind many other consumer-facing industries, and playing catchup with constantly rising customer expectations. At the same time, tech and operations platforms are in dire need of modernization. Across the industry, firms remain saddled with tech debt, manually intensive processes, and complex servicing arrangements, leading to stubbornly high operating costs, reduced (and sometimes negative) operating leverage, and unrelenting margin pressure.

However, some firms have started to capitalize on these technologies. For example, chatbots are now regularly deployed in online customer support, creating efficiency gains.

Despite North American wealth-management firms' slow progress in the application of robotics and AI, the future is promising. The technology is rapidly maturing, and domain expertise is developing among both wealth managers and vendors, many of which are moving away from the one-solution-fits-all approach and toward more specialized solutions. Firms are also learning critical lessons about workflow; for example, how to more effectively manage handoffs between man and machine, and where typical process redesign/reengineering can be put off or even skipped in favor of automation--particularly where systems are likely to be replaced. In addition, the technological instrumentation of processes will enable the extensive measurement and collection of data, which will support innovation and the ability to make the technologies smarter and self-adjusting.

We expect two winning models to emerge over the next decade: the first will be a handful of at-scale wealth managers offering the full spectrum of advice and engagement models for all client segments; the second model will comprise more exclusive, ultra/high-net-worth (U/HNW)-focused institutions that provide white-glove, specialized capabilities and services (for example, access to private markets, and estate and legacy planning services). While the latter group will be largely comprised of wire houses, private banks, and registered investment advisers that already specialize in the U/HNW segment, the former will be made up of a wider set of institutions, from direct firms to full-service firms and private banks. Two sets of dynamics are at work here:

Over the next decade, we expect the continuation of consolidation in the industry, especially among direct firms that fail to crack the HNW segment and struggle to differentiate upward. In addition, we expect that many traditional firms will fail to integrate downward and will remain completely upmarket, with a family-office/private-bank model serving only the wealthiest clients and continuing to charge premium fees justified by highly bespoke products and services.

The convergence of banking and wealth management is beginning, as evidenced by major banks building new wealth-management offerings and, in turn, wealth managers building out their banking capabilities. These dynamics will continue, as customers increasingly demand integrated financial advice across their investments and cash-management needs (that is, checking and savings) and as wealth managers seek to tap into banking profit pools.

This convergence is a win-win situation for institutions that currently have both a wealth manager and a more traditional bank--the wealth manager can expand the isolated investment relationship it maintains with clients to one that addresses their primary financial-services needs. Retail banking relationships help increase stickiness and are a prime source of low-cost deposits for funding needs.

In the coming decade, banking/wealth-management ecosystems will become more commonplace and begin to accrue advantages that will multiply over time (for example, more customer data, stickier relationships, cross-sell opportunities), putting competitive pressure on those wealth managers who remain stand-alone.

Wealth managers must act today as follows to prepare for the new age in wealth management:

The North American wealth-management industry will undergo meaningful shifts in the next ten years, influenced by evolving customer segments and rules of engagement, rapid technological advances, and shifting competitive dynamics. These trends will have profound implications for both the nature of advice and for advisers' and wealth-management firms' broader talent strategy, operating model, and sources of competitive differentiation. There are challenges and opportunities on the horizon--those wealth-management firms that rise to the occasion and embrace the change will be in a position to thrive.

"3","A more effective model for managing change in Japan could accelerate economic growth","Andre Andonian , Maya Horii , Naoyuki Iwatani , Michele Raviscioni , Katsuhiro Sato","July 6, 2018","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/a-more-effective-model-for-managing-change-in-japan-could-accelerate-economic-growth","2","Leaders across Japan's private and public sectors are trying to reignite growth and achieve levels of performance and productivity on par with global standards. From ""Abenomics"" to the 2020 Olympics, the case for change in Japan is firm and visible. Ever-increasing competition and a shift of innovation away from sectors where Japan was traditionally strong (from hardware manufacturing to services and software, for example) are pushing Japanese champions to globalize their practices. Slow domestic growth and sluggish modernization of the operating model mean that multinational companies must struggle to deliver the profits they once did in Japan. Many services that have been streamlined and digitized in the West, for instance, are still human powered, at a high level of customization.

But global companies trying to take a page from the usual change-management playbook may struggle in Japan. Domestic experience is limited, and a more effective approach has yet to emerge. Change management is a complex endeavor inspiring multiple perspectives. Research suggests that only a third of change-management programs globally achieve their original objectives. Employee resistance is a factor in a significant proportion of programs that fail.

A few core elements of change management are universally recognized: inspirational and effective change leaders to act as role models; a change story, with real meaning, to persuade leaders and employees; new mind-sets and behavior among employees; and the orchestration of change in an expanding, self-sustaining wave throughout the organization. But our experience supporting change efforts in leading Japanese organizations (and in multinational organizations in Japan) suggests that this approach must be adapted to the country's specific conditions.

A change-management approach focused on ""the last man standing""--in addition to the ""change leader or agent"" model at the core of most Western approaches--may be the one most suitable for consensus-driven organizations in Japan and other cultures. Leaders in Japan understand that change programs fail at the middle-management level, where just a few people (or even one) can impede the consensus-building process. We believe that change-management programs can increase their chances of success not by fighting a consensus-oriented culture (or by strengthening the top-down communication cascade) but by focusing greater effort on the potential blockers. A set of simple practices can increase the chances of success in major transformations.

Here we share our observations and lessons on how to drive change in Japan. The objective is not to treat the subject exhaustively but rather to provide empirical observations from our experience.

Certain tenets of change management are well accepted in global businesses but don't work well in Japanese organizations (exhibit).

Change leaders have a pivotal role in driving change. They take the first step in a new direction, they show others a new way, they take risks, and they trigger a cascade of change throughout their organizations. First-mover leaders in the West have a strong sense of mission, a passion for innovation, financial incentives, pressures (for instance, from shareholders)--or a mix of all these. CEOs are usually groomed and chosen to drive change at various levels of the organization because of their record in driving performance. Most important, global CEOs are appointed with a mission and chosen for their ability to deliver on goals. Shareholders believe that these leaders are up to the next challenge and the next opportunity.

But Japanese companies are ""middle-up"" rather than top-down. Many (though not all) senior leaders of traditional Japanese corporations hold their positions in recognition of their past contributions and their ability to navigate disparate divisions of the organization through long rotation programs. Pressure from shareholders is lower; many companies still do not have independent boards that represent them. Finances are managed on longer cycles--midterm plans cover three to five years, with only a negligible emphasis on quarterly performance. A culture of harmony values coordination and smooth collaboration rather than standing out or pushing unilateral initiatives. This culture makes it less likely that change leaders will emerge and assert themselves by taking risks and role-modeling new ways of working. The conditions in which that might happen simply do not exist.

Although this mind-set survives crisis situations, a crisis does help to identify leaders of change. Those in Japanese companies tend to fall into either of two categories. The first consists of outsiders: company executives initially rotated outside of headquarters and brought back to take on a risky challenge. Middle managers, the second category, take responsibility for driving change because they are committed to the future of the organization or to a vision of how the company could change.

Immediate followers play a key role in the transformation of global organizations. By adopting and mirroring the change leader's behavior, these executives bring it into the mainstream, amplify it, make it acceptable to the rest of the organization, and redefine the norms of the broader group. A first-mover change leader who doesn't rapidly build a critical mass of managers is just a visionary without impact.

In traditional Japanese organizations, the followers' role is equally important, but reversed. Top leaders are appointed to recognize their past contributions, but people on this second level are under pressure to prove their capabilities and improve the company's performance. This creates a risk-averse environment where mistakes are costly. In the absence of meaningful role-modeling from the top, decisions about change are made without any sense of what the leader will accept. What's more, a consensus-oriented culture discourages behavior that could be perceived as negatively affecting someone else. At the beginning, any change does trigger negative consequences for others, since it requires related changes to accommodate an overall new way of working.

In summary, the conditions in which immediate followers could follow do not exist in Japan. Creating them would not be a simple change-management process--it often involves achieving the change itself. Second-level management often becomes an obstacle to any change and stifles the drive for innovation and improvement in the corporate operating model and culture.

A well-crafted change story describes why change must happen, provides a case for it, connects intimately with employees, and is relevant for all of them. Far from acting in isolation, the change story should be accompanied by programs to build new processes and capabilities. The first step is getting people to buy into change, with details to follow.

Many Japanese companies still rely on practices and processes learned through apprenticeship, over years of collaborative work, rather than through structured corporate capability-building programs. Role descriptions are often vague, and responsibilities are shared among many employees; as a result, accountability is diluted. Changing this unwritten way of working, established at companies where many employees have spent years working together, is harder than changing a well-articulated, periodically refreshed business process. To drive change, leaders need to be more specific about what is expected from whom.

The hierarchical nature of traditional Japanese organizations is mistakenly interpreted as top-down: leaders set the pace, and the rest of the organization executes. This is true only in mature execution settings. In turbulent times, hierarchical organizations look upward to gauge and interpret what the leadership wants and find little direction, since leaders and followers alike resist acting. Wary of making the first step, they also look around for guidance to their peers. This keeps change from spreading and sustaining itself.

A ""cell-to-cell"" approach involves the early and detailed engagement of the front line in defining the new model, coupled with extensive peer-to-peer endorsement and advocacy. The level of detail and specifics would be considered premature or too detailed in Anglo-Saxon organizations, but in our experience, this approach works best at lending credibility to change programs in Japan.

In a consensus-oriented organization, a single individual can derail change--even in late stages and even in lower levels of the organization. Management practices devote too little attention to identifying this so-called last man standing, who is unusually averse to change, in traditional Japanese organizations. Any leader in Japan is familiar with the extensive time invested in cultivating support, even at low levels and in peripheral parts of the organization. While it can be tempting to dismiss this approach as inefficient, we suggest devising more efficient ways to turn it into an instrument of change.

What is the way forward for Japanese organizations? Several suggestions can be useful:

Define the end state in detail and provide a road map quite early. In our experience, the vision of change leaders has little practical effect if it isn't accompanied by a detailed description of the new model early in the process. Consensus-driven organizations need a detailed description of the end state to engage with it and establish a new consensus. Western companies launch a transformation based on a vision and engage the organization to define the new model. But in Japanese companies, this step must occur earlier, before a broader group is engaged. ""Building a plane as we fly"" is never easy, but in these Japanese organizations it is a nonstarter.

Engage the front line very early and create opportunities to endorse change. Spend time in the field (for example, on the factory floor or with the sales force) to define the details of the new model, anticipate issues, and allow people to participate emotionally in the process of change by sharing their frustrations and aspirations. Instead of relying on the immediate followers in the organization's second level, companies should identify, groom, and deploy champions of change on the front line.

Map the organizational network and tackle the last man standing. Mapping organizational networks can identify and empower change agents. Identifying potential blockers isn't difficult, and that is even more important for successful change. Action can be taken to convert or neutralize change blockers early in the process.

Expose top management extensively, broadly, and directly. The typical change cascade propagated through change agents often struggles in traditional Japanese organizations for the reasons described above. Town-hall meetings, Q&A sessions, and other venues where top management is directly exposed to a large audience are much more effective. While this approach sacrifices intimacy, it does break through the organization's vertical walls, overrides internal factions, and conveys a call to action that engages each member of the organization directly.

Create a team to tackle the last man standing. To mitigate the risks emanating from the last man standing, organizations need a ""last team standing."" That team should not only include diverse skill sets and cover complementary areas but also embrace a common determination to drive change and endure the short-term difficulties that come with it. Investing up front in such a purposeful team goes a long way in sustaining change and embedding the new model's procedural and cultural elements.

In this context, the ""third generation"" of leaders, roughly in the age bracket of 35 to 45 years old, is becoming an important source of energy for change. We have briefly touched upon the attitudes and roles of top management and its immediate followers above. People in the third group, emerging from years of economic stagnation, never experienced the golden times of productivity growth and innovation in Japan. Increasingly, they realize that they have a future to build, not a legacy to protect. Their decreased sense of security makes them more open to risk than previous generations and willing to undergo change if they are well supported within the organization.

Japan's aging and shrinking population and slow economy make the need for change loom larger than ever in Japanese companies. The lack of generally accepted approaches for managing change is one of the key obstacles to the modernization of the public and private sectors. In this paper, we have shared lessons from successful change programs based on culturally attuned principles.

"4","Getting personal about change","Scott Keller , Bill Schaninger","August 21, 2019","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/getting-personal-about-change","2","A surefire way to shoot yourself in the foot when you're leading a large-scale change effort is to ignore what's on the minds of your employees. In research we conducted for our recently published book, Beyond Performance 2.0 (John Wiley & Sons, July 2019), we found that executives at exactly zero companies that disregarded an analysis of employee mind-sets during a change program rated the transformation as ""extremely successful."" Conversely, executives at companies that took the time and trouble to address mind-sets were four times more likely than those that didn't to rate their change programs as at least ""successful.""

Those numbers reflect the power of mind-set shifts. In human systems, they help to achieve the same effect as the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly or a tadpole into a frog: when employees become open to new ways of looking at what's possible for them and their organization, they can never return to a state of not having that broader perspective, just as butterflies and frogs can't revert to their previous physical forms. To achieve such a metamorphosis, leaders must first identify the limiting mind-sets, then reframe them appropriately, and finally make sure that employees don't revert to earlier forms of behavior. In this article, we take readers through the process to shift mind-sets, with a particular emphasis on why the final stage is so important and so difficult.

The story of the Manchester Shoe Company, told by Benjamin Zander in his book The Art of Possibility, neatly encapsulates the significance of a positive mind-set. In the early 1900s, inspired by a desire to enter a faraway market, two traveling salesmen were sent as a beachhead into the region. A few days later, two telegraphs came back independently. One said, ""Situation horrible. They don't wear shoes!"" The other said, ""Glorious opportunity; they don't have any shoes yet!"" Imagine what would have happened if the company had acted only on the first message.

Now consider Gary Hamel and C. K. Prahalad's management fable of four monkeys sitting in a cage staring at a bunch of bananas accessible only by steps hanging from the roof. Whenever the monkeys try to climb the steps to reach the bananas, a blast of cold water blocks them. After a few days, realizing there's no point in trying to get the ""forbidden fruit,"" they naturally give up. Some humans in the room then remove the water hose and, at the same time, replace one of the original monkeys with a new one. On seeing the bananas, it starts up the steps, but the other simians, being social creatures, pull it down before it gets blasted by water. The new monkey is startled, looks around, and tries repeatedly to scale the ladder, only to be repeatedly pulled back. Finally, the new monkey accepts the group code of conduct and doesn't bother to go for the bananas.

Over the next few weeks, the onlookers remove the rest of the original monkeys, one at a time, and replace them with new monkeys that have never seen the water. By the end of the experiment, with perfectly ripe bananas sitting on the platform above, and monkeys that have never seen a jet of water, none of the animals tries to climb the steps. They've all learned the unwritten rule: ""you don't grab the bananas around here.""

Hamel and Prahalad created this story not to represent any actual findings from the field of primatology but instead as a potent and memorable way to demonstrate a wider truth about organizational life--namely, that mind-sets ingrained by past management practices remain ingrained far beyond the existence of the practices that formed them, even when new management practices have been put in place.

Here are three business examples that underscore the perils of ignoring this lesson. Example one: a bank that identified how its high performers succeeded in cross-selling decided to roll out a change program with support scripts and good profiling questions for the other bankers to use--and was dismayed to find that these moves had a negligible impact on sales. A second example: a telco introduced a dramatically simplified process and rating system for performance reviews only to find that its leaders still avoided delivering tough messages. Finally: a manufacturer invested hundreds of millions in a knowledge-management technology platform meant to discourage hoarding and encourage collaboration--only to declare, several months later, that the system had been a complete failure.

In all these examples, the companies did a good job of recognizing the behavioral change needed to achieve the desired goals. Yet they didn't take the time, or use the tools available, to understand why smart, hard-working, and well-intentioned employees continued to behave as before (see sidebar, ""Uncovering unconscious mind-sets"").

The primary tool for uncovering subconscious mind-sets is an interview technique known as ""laddering,"" grounded in the theory of personal change set out by Dennis Hinkle in 1965. The ladder employs techniques such as role playing, posing hypothetical questions, provoking participants, prompting storytelling, and drawing linkages between current and previous statements. These efforts prompt people to reflect on their deepest motives and eventually lead them to state the values and assumptions they use to construct their personal world.

Although the laddering technique is powerful, its limitation is that it's hard to scale in large, diverse organizations. A complementary technique, which provides for gathering a broader and deeper fact base about what's going on beneath the surface, uses focus groups and visual cues. This approach involves putting a hundred or so pictures on a table and asking participants to choose the images that best represent their feelings on a given topic--for example: ""What most energizes or frustrates you about the organization?"" ""What is your greatest hope for the organization?"" ""Which image represents what it's like selling to customers?"" ""Which image represents how it feels to be in a performance review?"" ""Which image represents how collaboration and knowledge sharing work around here?"" Pictures trigger a more honest, emotive, and visceral conversation than stock questions that start with ""Tell me about . . .""

The third tool for more broadly understanding organizational mind-sets comes from the social-science methodology known as qualitative data analysis (QDA). This technique mines rich sources of textual data (such as reports, websites, advertisements, internal communications, and press coverage). It then uses linguistic techniques (narrative, framework, and discourse analysis) to identify recurring themes and search for causality. One basic and straightforward QDA method that many people are familiar with is the use of word clouds.

At the bank, for instance, two seemingly good but ultimately performance-limiting mind-sets accounted for the failure of the new sales-stimulation tools and training. The first was ""my job is to give the customers what they want""; the second, ""I should follow the Golden Rule and treat my customers as I would like to be treated."" At the telco, employees had a deep-seated, reasonable-sounding belief that ""criticism damages relationships."" At the manufacturing company, people had an underlying conviction that ""around here, information is power, and good leaders are powerful leaders.""

The upshot? By looking at--and acting on--only observable behavior, company leaders overlooked its underlying root causes. Consequently, the change efforts of all three organizations led to disappointment.

Once the root-cause mind-sets are identified, the next step is to reframe those beliefs and thereby expand the range of reasonable behavioral choices employees make, day in and day out. That creates the caterpillar-to-butterfly effect described earlier. Would different beliefs, for example, have inspired expanded and better-informed behavioral choices for average-performing bankers? If so, which beliefs? Suppose they believed that their job--indeed, the way they add value for others--was to ""help customers fully understand their needs"" rather than ""giving customers what they want."" Also, what if instead of applying the ""Golden Rule,"" bankers applied the ""Platinum Rule"": treating others as they (rather than bankers) want to be treated.

And what if the telco executives, in their performance-management discussions, had believed that ""honesty--combined with respect--doesn't damage relationships; in fact, it is essential to building strong ones""? And what if the manufacturing managers had thought that ""sharing information rather than hoarding is the best way to magnify power""? Had they believed that, the company very likely wouldn't have needed an expensive (and ultimately futile) knowledge-management system to help employees reach out to one another and share best practices.

Beneath each of the reframes described above, it's important to note, lies a deeper shift in worldview. For example, moving from the giving-customers-what-they-want mind-set to helping them fully understand what they really need reflects a move from subordinate to peer. Recognizing that honesty builds rather than destroys relationships reflects a shift from victimhood to mastery. And choosing to believe that power is expanded by sharing information, not that hoarding information is power, focuses on abundance, not scarcity.

The best examples of naming and reframing are not only profound (using practical, relatable terms that reflect these deeper changes in worldview) but also insightful (raising the subconscious to consciousness in ways that expand possibility), memorable (so issues can easily be raised and discussed in day-to-day work), and meaningful (specific to the organization and evoking a ""that's so us!"" response).

In this way, a retailer found it vital to shift from ""listening and responding"" (a reactive mind-set) to ""anticipating and shaping"" (a proactive one), and an engineering company that wanted to improve the way it captured external ideas found that it was consistently overoptimistic about results and underestimated its competitors. This company came to realize that these shortcomings were driven by a ""winning means being peerless"" (expert) mind-set, which led to increasingly insular behavior. Changing to the learner mind-set--""winning means learning more and faster than others""--prompted employees to look for best practices in competitors and beyond.

Human-health analogies reinforce the message of business examples. Consider the predicament of people with heart disease. Years of research have shown that most cardiac patients live considerably longer if they cut out smoking and drinking, eat less fat, reduce their stress levels, and exercise regularly. Indeed, many patients make a real effort to do so. Yet study after study has shown that 90 percent of people who have undergone surgery for heart disease revert to unhealthy behavior within two years.

Dean Ornish, a professor of medicine at the University of California at San Francisco and founder of the Preventive Medicine Research Institute, decided to reframe the underlying mind-set beneath the patients' narratives. He wanted to change it from ""If I behave this way, I won't die"" (fear driven) to ""If I behave this way, my life will be filled with joy"" (hope driven). In his words, ""Telling people who are lonely and depressed that they're going to live longer if they quit smoking or change their diet and lifestyle is not that motivating. Who wants to live longer when you're in chronic emotional pain?"" How much better would they feel, he thought, if they could enjoy the pleasures of daily life without suffering any pain or discomfort? In his experiment, 77 percent of his patients managed to make permanent changes in their lifestyles, compared with a normal success rate of 10 percent.

Reframing the root causes of mind-sets that block change is a critical step in the right direction and can sometimes create the desired shift in behavior on its own. At the aforementioned bank, for example, once employees were exposed to the Platinum Rule, they could immediately see how much more productive following it would be. They simply had never previously thought about the impact on customers of the way bankers had been relating to them.

More often than not, however, employees struggle to change their behavior for reasons that are more emotional than intellectual. The single biggest barrier to rapid personal change, after all, is our propensity as leaders to say, ""Yes, that's the problem and the shift we need. If only others would change how they think and behave, we would make more progress.""

At one company we know, for example, leaders were asked to estimate how much time they spent tiptoeing around other people's egos: making others feel that ""my idea is yours,"" for instance, or taking care not to tread on someone else's turf. Most said 20 to 30 percent. Then they were asked how much time they spent tiptoeing around their own egos. Most were silent. Psychology explains this dynamic as a very predictable, and very human, ""self-serving bias."" It involves viewing our own actions favorably and interpreting events in a way beneficial to ourselves. This explains why 25 percent of students rate themselves in the top 1 percent in their ability to get along with others. It's why, when couples are asked to estimate their contribution to household work, the combined total routinely exceeds 100 percent.

In many behavior-related areas, we human beings consistently overestimate how much we are part of the solution, not the problem, and role modeling change is one of these areas. On average, when leaders are asked if they ""role model desired behavior changes,"" a full 86 percent report that they do. When the same question is put to people who report to these leaders, it receives only a 53 percent average positive response.

How best, then, to overcome this bias and help leaders and employees commit to changing themselves? Our own journey has led us to the deep conviction that offsite, workshop-based learning journeys of small groups of 20 to 30 employees are the most powerful intervention. These are typically centered on in-person working sessions, over two days, led by facilitators experienced in the principles of adult learning and knowledgeable in techniques developed in the field of human potential. The workshop methodology is grounded in the ""U-process""--a social technology developed during a ten-year partnership between Generon International, Otto Scharmer and Peter Senge from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and the Society for Organizational Learning. The U-process has three phases:

Following these workshops, small groups typically convene to offer peer accountability and advice. After a number of weeks, there is a further facilitated session to take stock of changes in behavior.

We acknowledge that this approach will sound unduly ""soft"" to some. But we've seen it have a transformational impact on everyone from Dutch engineers to American investment bankers to Middle Eastern government officials to employees of South Korean conglomerates. While some organizations put all their employees through such a workshop, they can achieve most of the impact through a critical mass of people leaders, which the field of epidemiology has shown to be, typically, 25 to 30 percent of the total. In these cases, all leaders eventually shed the ""if only they would change"" mentality and replace it with a profound sense of ""if it's to be, it's up to me.""

Not every successful change program we have seen uses these techniques, but in our experience every change program that used them (in the context of other recommended interventions) has been successful, and in time frames far faster than most leaders had expected. The effect can be particularly positive when organizations grapple with how to thaw what's often referred to as ""the frozen middle""--a change-resistant layer of middle managers.

Victor Frankl was an Auschwitz survivor whose seminal book, Man's Search for Meaning, has long challenged and inspired readers across academic and professional disciplines. He summed up, in a compelling way, the full picture of what it takes to achieve caterpillar-to-butterfly-like personal change when he wrote: ""Between stimulus and response there is a space. In that space is our power to choose our response."" We find it helpful to use a shorthand version of Frankl's idea: S (stimulus) + T (how you choose to think about the stimulus) = R (response).

The S in this equation is vital for the aforementioned work on the T to fully take hold: after all, as the story of the monkeys illustrates, the work environment is a particularly powerful shaper of employee mind-sets and behavior, albeit a relatively slow-acting one. Nonetheless, if employees come out of workshops committed to change but find themselves back in the very same work environment that had ingrained their original mind-sets, it's far less likely that the new mind-sets will become truly personal--or permanent.

By way of analogy, imagine that you go to the opera on Saturday and to a sporting event on Sunday. At the climax of the opera, the very best part, you sit silent and rapt in concentration. You and the rest of the audience then offer a genteel clap. At the climax of the sporting event, also the very best part, you leap to your feet, yelling and waving and jumping up and down. You haven't changed; you are the same person with the same feelings, values, and needs. But your context has changed, and so has your mind-set about the behavior that is appropriate for expressing appreciation and enjoyment--and therefore the behavior you choose to exhibit and the practices you choose to participate in.

When it comes to changing the stimulus (the S)--the work environment--employees are exposed to, we find that the four levers in McKinsey's ""influence model"" offer the most practical and proven guide (exhibit).1
Our research and experience demonstrate that changes in thinking and behaving will be significant and sustained if leaders and employees see clear communications and rituals (the understanding and conviction lever); if supporting incentives, structures, processes, and systems are in place (the formal-mechanisms lever); if training and development opportunities are combined with sound talent decisions (the confidence and skills lever); and if senior leaders and influence leaders2
allow others to take their cues from the leaders' own behavior (the role-modeling lever).

Many leaders wonder which of the four levers is the most important. Evidence shows that they all matter, with minor statistical variations in degree, and that people do not have to experience them in any particular order--the key is to ensure that all of them are experienced consistently. Communicating to employees that you want them to adopt sports-stadium mind-sets, practices, and behavior is no use if your evaluation systems, and the leadership moves that employees see, are those of the opera house. If you want people to think like sports fans, you must create a stadium environment that encourages and enables them to think and act differently.

We've discussed the importance and value of both the stimulus (the S) and the thinking (the T) separately, but in reality they are profoundly linked. One person's mind-sets (the T) drive that person's behavior (the R), which becomes the role-modeling part of the S for those who interact with this person--a testament to the importance of starting changes in the T at the top.

It's no accident that we've used a lot of stories in this article. Storytelling is powerful: it goes beyond facts and figures to stimulate and shape mind-sets. Thinking in terms of stories is also a helpful reminder that change is ultimately personal, as every story is open to individual interpretation and individual meaning. Along the same lines, if you want to lead change, you must take on both the contextual and personal dimensions. Mastering them is a challenge but also can be incredibly rewarding--not just for the organizations and people you're trying to lead but also for you as a leader and, ultimately, as a person.

"5","Managing change and release","Nico Berhausen , Eric Hannon","March 20, 2018","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/managing-change-and-release","2","In many technology-heavy industries, delays in product launches cause significant negative impact for the companies. Famous examples are delays in electricity or infrastructure projects, where fixed prices have been negotiated and penalties for not meeting the deadlines are common. One well-known example is the nuclear power plant Olkiluoto in Finland, that has at least seven years delay in completion and will cost at least three times as much as initially planned. But this is not a single event, there are many more examples.

In the automotive industry, launch problems cause not only additional internal costs. Marketing and sales plans are also jeopardized, delays can spill over to subsequent launches, and lost revenues can amount to high figures: we estimate them at approximately € 2 billion for a four months overdue launch, assuming that the customers will turn to competitors' products.

While industrial companies typically do well when it comes to stand-alone launches, managing the technology, platforms, parts, and service providers/outsourcers becomes more complex when handling multiple, interdependent launches in parallel. And because these companies often build complete product lines based upon common platforms, a single launch delay can have a huge domino effect.

These problems are becoming more acute as industrial companies launch more and more new products customized to local consumer needs and tastes. As they continue to establish global production footprints in order to be closer to customers and meet local requirements, more plants and local suppliers are making launches increasingly commonplace and evermore complex.

One major driver of launch delays is the fact that technical changes are becoming more frequent during product development and production phase-in, which often results in a significant change-order-processing backlog. For example, if at the start of preseries production the first sample parts from suppliers fail to meet specifications, they must be redesigned.

Later on, with production lines scheduled to begin serial output, industrial companies often have trouble fine-tuning new product tooling. Another common problem is late input from customers and unexpected test and validation results that cause product design changes and launch delays. Finally, at the start of production, critical suppliers often struggle to meet the production ramp-up timeline, resulting in parts shortages.

The bottom line is this: advanced industries need better technical change management. Some companies are already tackling this issue head on. McKinsey has worked with several companies to rescue failed launches and uses lessons learned as the starting point for building better launch execution capabilities.

For example, one automobile company realized about a year prior to a scheduled launch that production would be delayed several months due to product quality concerns, a lack of adequate supplier preparations, behind-schedule engineering releases, and product milestone overruns.

To address these issues, the company established a cross-functional launch team that included manufacturing, engineering, procurement, quality assurance, and product management. It assigned clear roles and responsibilities, and team leaders were told to drive cross-functional problem solving and decision making. The company ensured quick decision making by creating a clearly defined schedule of daily check-in meetings that fed biweekly status reviews by a dedicated change committee.

In our experience, improving change management involves two critical steps: introducing transparency into the process and then accelerating the change order process to reduce the processing backlog and keep launches on schedule (Exhibit 1).

Transparency is particularly critical--and often lacking--during series development, the time period between nomination of the supplier and the final tooling release for purchased parts. Identifying necessary changes early on during this period is vital because changes become increasingly expensive to fix as suppliers start to work on their tools for the parts (Exhibit 2).

To improve transparency, a cross-functional component team needs to be established at the operational level as well as a dedicated change committee consisting of project members at the management level that decide on change requests. The cross-functional team drives three key tasks:

With the help of this transparency, industrial companies can accelerate change order processes to improve overall change management. We have identified six significant weaknesses in the processes of many companies and developed corresponding core actions to accelerate the change order process (Exhibit 3).

Due in part to these change management efforts, the automobile company in our example recovered from the anticipated delay. It actually reduced projected launch costs by about 40 percent and reached peak production levels even earlier than planned: in the first ten months, the company achieved sales volumes 80 percent higher than forecast. Due to this impressive success, the company's management decided to make the process a blueprint for its launch system.

As this example shows, strong technical product launch and change management capabilities enable advanced industries to achieve and even exceed their commercial aspirations, while weak capabilities can exacerbate already serious challenges.

"6","The four building blocks of change","Tessa Basford , Bill Schaninger","April 11, 2016","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-four-building-blocks--of-change","2","Large-scale organizational change has always been difficult, and there's no shortage of research showing that a majority of transformations continue to fail. Today's dynamic environment adds an extra level of urgency and complexity. Companies must increasingly react to sudden shifts in the marketplace, to other external shocks, and to the imperatives of new business models. The stakes are higher than ever.

So what's to be done? In both research and practice, we find that transformations stand the best chance of success when they focus on four key actions to change mind-sets and behavior: fostering understanding and conviction, reinforcing changes through formal mechanisms, developing talent and skills, and role modeling. Collectively labeled the ""influence model,"" these ideas were introduced more than a dozen years ago in a McKinsey Quarterly article, ""The psychology of change management."" They were based on academic research and practical experience--what we saw worked and what didn't.

Digital technologies and the changing nature of the workforce have created new opportunities and challenges for the influence model (for more on the relationship between those trends and the model, see this article's companion, ""Winning hearts and minds in the 21st century""). But it still works overall, a decade and a half later (exhibit). In a recent McKinsey Global Survey, we examined successful transformations and found that they were nearly eight times more likely to use all four actions as opposed to just one.1
Building both on classic and new academic research, the present article supplies a primer on the model and its four building blocks: what they are, how they work, and why they matter.

We know from research that human beings strive for congruence between their beliefs and their actions and experience dissonance when these are misaligned. Believing in the ""why"" behind a change can therefore inspire people to change their behavior. In practice, however, we find that many transformation leaders falsely assume that the ""why"" is clear to the broader organization and consequently fail to spend enough time communicating the rationale behind change efforts.

This common pitfall is predictable. Research shows that people frequently overestimate the extent to which others share their own attitudes, beliefs, and opinions--a tendency known as the false-consensus effect. Studies also highlight another contributing phenomenon, the ""curse of knowledge"": people find it difficult to imagine that others don't know something that they themselves do know. To illustrate this tendency, a Stanford study asked participants to tap out the rhythms of well-known songs and predict the likelihood that others would guess what they were. The tappers predicted that the listeners would identify half of the songs correctly; in reality, they did so less than 5 percent of the time.2

Therefore, in times of transformation, we recommend that leaders develop a change story that helps all stakeholders understand where the company is headed, why it is changing, and why this change is important. Building in a feedback loop to sense how the story is being received is also useful. These change stories not only help get out the message but also, recent research finds, serve as an effective influencing tool. Stories are particularly effective in selling brands.3

Even 15 years ago, at the time of the original article, digital advances were starting to make employees feel involved in transformations, allowing them to participate in shaping the direction of their companies. In 2006, for example, IBM used its intranet to conduct two 72-hour ""jam sessions"" to engage employees, clients, and other stakeholders in an online debate about business opportunities. No fewer than 150,000 visitors attended from 104 countries and 67 different companies, and there were 46,000 posts.4
As we explain in ""Winning hearts and minds in the 21st century,"" social and mobile technologies have since created a wide range of new opportunities to build the commitment of employees to change.

Psychologists have long known that behavior often stems from direct association and reinforcement. Back in the 1920s, Ivan Pavlov's classical conditioning research showed how the repeated association between two stimuli--the sound of a bell and the delivery of food--eventually led dogs to salivate upon hearing the bell alone. Researchers later extended this work on conditioning to humans, demonstrating how children could learn to fear a rat when it was associated with a loud noise.5
Of course, this conditioning isn't limited to negative associations or to animals. The perfume industry recognizes how the mere scent of someone you love can induce feelings of love and longing.

Reinforcement can also be conscious, shaped by the expected rewards and punishments associated with specific forms of behavior. B. F. Skinner's work on operant conditioning showed how pairing positive reinforcements such as food with desired behavior could be used, for example, to teach pigeons to play Ping-Pong. This concept, which isn't hard to grasp, is deeply embedded in organizations. Many people who have had commissions-based sales jobs will understand the point--being paid more for working harder can sometimes be a strong incentive.

Despite the importance of reinforcement, organizations often fail to use it correctly. In a seminal paper ""On the folly of rewarding A, while hoping for B,"" management scholar Steven Kerr described numerous examples of organizational-reward systems that are misaligned with the desired behavior, which is therefore neglected.6
Some of the paper's examples--such as the way university professors are rewarded for their research publications, while society expects them to be good teachers--are still relevant today. We ourselves have witnessed this phenomenon in a global refining organization facing market pressure. By squeezing maintenance expenditures and rewarding employees who cut them, the company in effect treated that part of the budget as a ""super KPI."" Yet at the same time, its stated objective was reliable maintenance.

Even when organizations use money as a reinforcement correctly, they often delude themselves into thinking that it alone will suffice. Research examining the relationship between money and experienced happiness--moods and general well-being--suggests a law of diminishing returns. The relationship may disappear altogether after around $75,000, a much lower ceiling than most executives assume.7

Money isn't the only motivator, of course. Victor Vroom's classic research on expectancy theory explained how the tendency to behave in certain ways depends on the expectation that the effort will result in the desired kind of performance, that this performance will be rewarded, and that the reward will be desirable.8
When a Middle Eastern telecommunications company recently examined performance drivers, it found that collaboration and purpose were more important than compensation (see ""Ahead of the curve: The future of performance management,"" forthcoming on McKinsey.com). The company therefore moved from awarding minor individual bonuses for performance to celebrating how specific teams made a real difference in the lives of their customers. This move increased motivation while also saving the organization millions.

How these reinforcements are delivered also matters. It has long been clear that predictability makes them less effective; intermittent reinforcement provides a more powerful hook, as slot-machine operators have learned to their advantage. Further, people react negatively if they feel that reinforcements aren't distributed fairly. Research on equity theory describes how employees compare their job inputs and outcomes with reference-comparison targets, such as coworkers who have been promoted ahead of them or their own experiences at past jobs.9
We therefore recommend that organizations neutralize compensation as a source of anxiety and instead focus on what really drives performance--such as collaboration and purpose, in the case of the Middle Eastern telecom company previously mentioned.

Thankfully, you can teach an old dog new tricks. Human brains are not fixed; neuroscience research shows that they remain plastic well into adulthood. Illustrating this concept, scientific investigation has found that the brains of London taxi drivers, who spend years memorizing thousands of streets and local attractions, showed unique gray-matter volume differences in the hippocampus compared with the brains of other people. Research linked these differences to the taxi drivers' extraordinary special knowledge.10

Despite an amazing ability to learn new things, human beings all too often lack insight into what they need to know but don't. Biases, for example, can lead people to overlook their limitations and be overconfident of their abilities. Highlighting this point, studies have found that over 90 percent of US drivers rate themselves above average, nearly 70 percent of professors consider themselves in the top 25 percent for teaching ability, and 84 percent of Frenchmen believe they are above-average lovers.11
This self-serving bias can lead to blind spots, making people too confident about some of their abilities and unaware of what they need to learn. In the workplace, the ""mum effect""--a proclivity to keep quiet about unpleasant, unfavorable messages--often compounds these self-serving tendencies.12

Even when people overcome such biases and actually want to improve, they can handicap themselves by doubting their ability to change. Classic psychological research by Martin Seligman and his colleagues explained how animals and people can fall into a state of learned helplessness--passive acceptance and resignation that develops as a result of repeated exposure to negative events perceived as unavoidable. The researchers found that dogs exposed to unavoidable shocks gave up trying to escape and, when later given an opportunity to do so, stayed put and accepted the shocks as inevitable.13
Like animals, people who believe that developing new skills won't change a situation are more likely to be passive. You see this all around the economy--from employees who stop offering new ideas after earlier ones have been challenged to unemployed job seekers who give up looking for work after multiple rejections.

Instilling a sense of control and competence can promote an active effort to improve. As expectancy theory holds, people are more motivated to achieve their goals when they believe that greater individual effort will increase performance.14
Fortunately, new technologies now give organizations more creative opportunities than ever to showcase examples of how that can actually happen.

Research tells us that role modeling occurs both unconsciously and consciously. Unconsciously, people often find themselves mimicking the emotions, behavior, speech patterns, expressions, and moods of others without even realizing that they are doing so. They also consciously align their own thinking and behavior with those of other people--to learn, to determine what's right, and sometimes just to fit in.

While role modeling is commonly associated with high-power leaders such as Abraham Lincoln and Bill Gates, it isn't limited to people in formal positions of authority. Smart organizations seeking to win their employees' support for major transformation efforts recognize that key opinion leaders may exert more influence than CEOs. Nor is role modeling limited to individuals. Everyone has the power to model roles, and groups of people may exert the most powerful influence of all. Robert Cialdini, a well-respected professor of psychology and marketing, examined the power of ""social proof""--a mental shortcut people use to judge what is correct by determining what others think is correct. No wonder TV shows have been using canned laughter for decades; believing that other people find a show funny makes us more likely to find it funny too.

Today's increasingly connected digital world provides more opportunities than ever to share information about how others think and behave. Ever found yourself swayed by the number of positive reviews on Yelp? Or perceiving a Twitter user with a million followers as more reputable than one with only a dozen? You're not imagining this. Users can now ""buy followers"" to help those users or their brands seem popular or even start trending.

The endurance of the influence model shouldn't be surprising: powerful forces of human nature underlie it. More surprising, perhaps, is how often leaders still embark on large-scale change efforts without seriously focusing on building conviction or reinforcing it through formal mechanisms, the development of skills, and role modeling. While these priorities sound like common sense, it's easy to miss one or more of them amid the maelstrom of activity that often accompanies significant changes in organizational direction. Leaders should address these building blocks systematically because, as research and experience demonstrate, all four together make a bigger impact.

Podcast transcript

Simon London: Hello, and welcome to this episode of the McKinsey Podcast, with me, Simon London. There is an oft-quoted statistic that about 70 percent of organizational-change programs fail to meet their objectives. This sobering fact actually comes from McKinsey research of a few years ago. And of course, it invites the question from executives, ""Is there anything we can do to radically increase the chances that our change program will succeed?"" The good news is, that yes, based on years of additional research and experience, we can say categorically that there is a way to flip the odds. The methodology is laid out in a new book, Beyond Performance 2.0: A Proven Approach to Leading Large-Scale Change [John Wiley & Sons, July 2019]. The book is actually a thoroughly revised and updated edition of the original Beyond Performance: How Great Organizations Build Ultimate Competitive Advantage [John Wiley & Sons, 2011], reflecting a decade of additional research into the science of organizational change.

To find out more, I caught up in Chicago with the authors of Beyond Performance 2.0, McKinsey senior partners Scott Keller and Bill Schaninger.

So, Scott and Bill, you've both done this before, but welcome to the podcast.

Scott Keller: Great to be here.

Bill Schaninger: Thank you for having us.

Scott Keller: Thanks for having us.

Simon London: You've written a book about organizational change, change management. And I think you would concede there are a lot of books out there on this topic. So why add to the pile?

Scott Keller: The promise of transformational change, which people use as a phrase often, what do they really mean by that? One analogy we use from nature about what people are trying to get at is the analogy of the caterpillar to a butterfly. And, why is that transformational change and not just change like you change your tires, you change your shirt, you change your shoes.

The key thing we think about in that kind of transformational-change environment is, you think about a caterpillar to a butterfly, this thing can't go back. To achieve change on the order of magnitude where it truly is a fundamental shift in how our organization operates that's self-perpetuating and self-improving upon, that just from a professional standpoint to help organizations and to help human beings achieve that level of change, that gets really exciting.

That's the type of change we're talking about in the book. Everyone sets out for a caterpillar-to-butterfly change. You look at ten people in a room, and you say, ""Great, you're going to go do this. Oh, by the way, seven of you are going to kind of waste your time."" It's not good enough for our clients. ""It's not good enough for humankind"" is sort of an underlying ethos of what we have. And so our view is, is there something new under the sun to share in the space? And we think there is. So why this book amidst all that, is because it actually says something different and something that we know works.

Simon London: There's this number that gets kicked around a lot, like rule of thumb: 30 percent of big change efforts succeed; 70 percent, frankly, don't meet their targets. That's what you're talking about when you're talking about the numbers and the success rates.

Bill Schaninger: We are. There's a known set of things. It's not mystical. That you can get that number, a likelihood of success up closer to 80 percent, but it's not easy. It does require resilience and ""stick-to-itiveness.""

And also it's not simple like, oh, one bullet's going to fix it. The more units you have, you have more people identifying with something smaller and smaller pieces that aren't the overall entity. Now you're trying to get all these people to do something different.

At its core, there's the metachange, which is the organization has to be faster. It has to make more money. Or it has to spend less, or it has to come out with new product lines quicker, all those sorts of things that are normal. One step underneath that, you go, ""Oh wait, we do have 200,000 employees in 50 countries.""

How are we going to get them to do this? That's the essence of it. The essence that the organization, itself, while an interesting construct, works or fails whether or not you get every individual in the organization to think and behave differently in a sustained manner in pursuit of something common.That's the hard part.

Simon London: So just to clarify because it's quite a big claim, that we think that if an organization follows the approach outlined in the book, they can get their odds of success up from the 30 percent closer to 80 percent.

Scott Keller: I would say we are reporting the facts when we say that. If the answer was 50 percent or if the answer was 33 percent, we would be bound to report the facts. We are saying that. Absolutely.

Bill Schaninger: The type of research we've done now over a decade, 2,500 organizations--had stayed in academics and not joined McKinsey, I would've been the toast of academia for this data set.

These findings are spectacular in a way that says, ""Hey, actually there's an interesting relationship here.""

Simon London: So let's get to the meat. What's the big idea?

Scott Keller: The big idea, if you want to see an increase from the 30 percent success rates to the 79 percent success rates, if you want to see caterpillar-to-butterfly results in terms of your change management, is to do what we call putting equal emphasis on the performance and the health elements of the change program you're leading. Let me talk about each of those.

First, on the performance side of things, this is what you're doing to deliver the operational and financial results that you're looking for. If I use a manufacturing example, this is what you're doing to buy things cheaper or of higher quality. It's what you're doing to make them into something else, more efficiently or more effectively. It's what you're doing to sell them into the market and service them better than you would have before.

Simon London: The changes you're making to your operations, broadly defined.

Scott Keller: Absolutely. It's really the what of what you're doing. Most leaders can get their head around that and say, ""Yes. I know what I want to do when I take over this department or this business or this company in terms of what needs to be done to improve performance.""

What doesn't often happen is that they put equal emphasis, time, effort, rigor, into the health side of the change. What's the health side? The health side is how do I align the organization on the direction we need to go? How do we execute in that direction with minimal friction in the system? How do we create a sense of meaning and renewal that fuels and perpetually improves the organization as we go? Performance is kind of the buy, make, sell side, then health is the align,execute, renew side of the change.

What organizational health is is it's a way to measure and manage that alignment, execution, and renewal as you're doing the work of the what--quite frankly, in an integrated way, which is what we'll get into when we talk about the methodology. Most leaders, by the way, when you share that with them, are intuitively like, ""Yeah, I mean, of course, we need to align the organization on the direction. We need to execute without friction in the system.""

Simon London: You've got to address the people stuff.

Scott Keller: We've got to do that. But if you ask them, ""Well, what would you do with 50 percent of your time if you're going to do that stuff?""

After town halls and memos, most people run out of like, well, I don't know. Which is where Beyond Performance 2.0 comes in is because it's a tool kit and a playbook for how you manage the people side of the equation with equal discipline and rigor to how you'd manage the what, or the performance side.

Simon London: All right. So let's talk a little bit about the change journey. In the book, you described it as being, basically, in five phases or stages.1
Just elaborate on that a little bit.

Scott Keller: Any change journey typically follows kind of an S-curve. That journey can be broken up, and we break it up into five stages.

The first stage is the aspiration stage. It's where you're actually trying to go. It sounds pretty basic, but you've got to have an answer both on the performance side--what are our strategic objectives? And on the health side--what are our health goals? It's less clear to a lot of leaders on how do you set health goals. Once you've got that, you've got a great kind of light on the hill, if you will.

That's our aspiration. What's an often-missed step and why our change journey has five steps instead of three, which a lot of them do. A lot of times you'll hear, ""You know, hey, diagnose, design, deliver."" Once you have that light on the hill, it's absolutely imperative that you take stock of your change readiness to go there [which is step two, assess].

The skill and will of your organization or the capabilities and mind-sets is the way we talk about it. That gives you a lot more information in terms of what you're going to need to do when you get to step three, which we call the architect stage. In the architect stage, you're actually creating the plan. And then you've got what we call the act stage, which is the fourth stage.

Now that stage actually takes most of the time. That's the steep part of the S-curve. You're actually doing those things you planned to do, or you're building the blueprint that you created. You are asking people to ride the bike while they're changing the tires. You are asking them to do more, so there's a lot of work to be done in that act phase in terms of being able to adjust as you go and to be able to manage the energy during the process. That's stage four.

Then you get to the fifth stage [advance], which is, again, why we have five often missed, which is you get to the top of that S-curve. Many change programs have a pretty big infrastructure to help drive them because this is an extraordinary act of increasing the metabolism of the organization.

There are PMOs [project-management offices] or transformation officers. There's a whole set of infrastructure. There's a whole set of the way communications work. To just dismantle those and to kind of let everything go back to where it was is typically a recipe for that S-curve not to look like an S but to look like a mound.

Things will revert back to the way they were before. To thoughtfully transition into a stage of continuous improvement is what that advance stage, that last stage, does.

Bill Schaninger: At the end of that fourth and fifth stage, you're looking back and saying, ""Actually, we're permanently changing the operating model. We're permanently changing the cadence and tenor and tone of management meetings and who gets to be in management."" It is as close as we can get to the switch to the butterfly because you dismantle all the old stuff.

Simon London: So let's assume I've done my aspiration both on the performance side and on the health side. I've got a sense of where I want to go, the kind of critter I want to be as an organization. What goes into that second stage?

Scott Keller: Stage two is really the crux of why we believe we achieve truly transformational change in that caterpillar-to-butterfly sense. It's that step two that when missed, people miss the opportunity for that fundamental shift in how an organization approaches work.

Bill Schaninger: If you lay out the scale of the change that's necessary on the performance side and some of the things that you should be doing seem obvious, then we should ask the question, ""Why would an otherwise well-intended person not already be doing it?"" You could have the people who are buying the equipment in procurement talk to the frontline operators who are using the equipment in the field. You get a blank stare and an ""Oh, why would we do that?""

So this idea of mind-sets and prevailing sentiments, if you think about when people behave, you know, they're not robots. They are all trying to solve for something. But particularly when you get to the lack of adoption of things that seem obvious, it does tend to break into things where it's not clear to them that they're allowed to do it, or they don't believe that they can either through time or resources, which is really just saying a priority thing. Or they don't want to. Sometimes the want to do stuff is really sticky, and it's intractable. Scott has a spectacular way of doing this with top teams where we can tease out some of these ""I-don't-want-tos"" because that gets into the world of power, influence, legacy, relationships, just wanting to be liked and accepted. There's a lot of smart people who have been derailed by those things.

Simon London: Do you find that senior execs, CEOs are often reluctant to tackle mind-sets?

Scott Keller: Yes. We find that's the case, and [that is] because it's, typically, the one they feel less equipped to add value or drive in terms of knowing what to do. It also feels a bit like, ""Are we putting our employees on the couch and being armchair psychologists here?""

However, once they're introduced to a robust tool kit, there's an interview technique called laddering that is used. There's a number of focus-group techniques that leverage visual cues as opposed to kind of traditional let's-just-talk-about-it type things that really surface underlying thought processes.

There's also a whole level of what they call QDA, qualitative data analysis. Most people are familiar with word clouds. That's a very simple version of qualitative data analysis. You can run a number of analyses that can give you lots of good cues and good evidence for what underlying mind-sets might be in an organization. Then the last thing, I think, when you play it out for leaders just in terms of practical--how does this actually work and why would you tend to it--most leaders are onboard right away.

Let me give you an example. Let's say your strategic objectives are we want to double share price. How are we going to do that? We're going to cross-sell more, bring the whole firm to our clients or the whole company to our customers. Essentially, that's the strategy. That's your strategic objective.

What are your health goals? Let's just say the analysis takes you to the health objectives of let's increase customer focus, let's get more knowledge sharing, let's improve how we do performance management--these changes to how we run the place that'll make the biggest difference.

We just finished the aspire stage. Now in that assess stage, on the performance side, you're going to assess capabilities. Do we have the capabilities we need? If not, where can we get them? You're going to get really sharp on that.

Well, let me go to the health side because this is the mind-set piece. When you play this through, what would most companies do if they just went straight to action if they need more knowledge sharing? Most companies would look for the companies who do this well. They would find that most of those companies have a large information infrastructure, kind of a portal that you can upload data on and download data on.

Simon London: Yeah, that's not so with knowledge management.

Scott Keller: Totally. They would invest hundreds of millions of dollars potentially building this knowledge infrastructure. What would most companies do for performance management? Similar, they'd look at best practice. They'd find that the years of the annual performance review and long-winded forms are done. They would go to form-light, regular-basis conversations, and they'd say, ""OK, that's going to really help us on performance management.""

Customer focused, they'd say, ""Well, what do great customer-focused, sales-oriented organizations do? They have salespeople who profile customers really well and understand their needs. They also know the product set really well, and so they match those two. Let's build scripts for our salespeople to ask the right questions, let's educate them on knowledge."" That's going to cost a ton of money to do all that. It might be the right thing to do.

To Bill's point, why are smart, hardworking people who are generally well intentioned not sharing knowledge today? You do the laddering interviews. You do the focus groups using some visual cues and different techniques. You do the QDA. Pretty quickly, you find, wow, here's the way people think. They might not consciously think it. But they're introduced into and indoctrinated into a culture where the mind-set that predominates is that knowledge is power: ""If I share my knowledge, I lose my advantage; if I share my knowledge, I find places for other people to poke holes and see what's going wrong; my goal is to not share any knowledge; my goal is to use the knowledge I have to actually let my performance be better than the next person.""

Now if you put in a big knowledge-management system and the mind-set is knowledge is power, people will give it lip service. They'll fulfill the KPIs [key performance indicators]. I submitted three things last month. And they'll never share anything of value.

They'll never draw on it for anything because they'll know it's useless. Now if you shifted the mind-set to, ""Your power in the organization is proportional only to the extent to which you share your knowledge""--if that was the mind-set, you probably wouldn't need the technology infrastructure. You probably would have people self-organizing into centers of excellence saying, ""Hey, let's share how we do this purchasing thing across the world. Let's share best practices."" They would find out who knows what, and they would get on the phone. You still might put in a system, but it's a completely different result.

Let me take the other two just because it really brings it to life. Performance management: if people think, ""You know what, giving people real feedback is a fast track to destroying relationships,"" no one wants to hear it. I'm not going to be the person who's going to do that. I want everyone to like me because that's a totally different mind-set than a mind-set that says, ""Real relationships have a foundation of honesty."" That's the only way to establish real trust with people. If you approach a performance review with that mind-set, it kind of doesn't matter what the forms are. It's just going to be a different conversation.

With salespeople, there are people who believe, ""My job is to give the customer what they want."" It's not a bad mind-set. A smart, hardworking, well-intentioned person could very well believe that. That's kind of their operating system. Great salespeople say, ""My job is not to be a subordinate to the person across from me, to kind of be the order taker, to give them what they want. My job is to add value in this conversation. My job is to help them understand what they really need."" I don't need a script if that's my mind-set because I will ask all of the questions that the company wants me to be asking. I will find out the product information. As soon as you get into this mind-set realm, you get to the root cause of why smart, hardworking, well-intentioned people aren't already behaving in the way that you want them to behave from a management-practice standpoint. You've unlocked the key to transformation because if you can shift that mind-set, people can't go back.

Simon London: OK. But the downside of this is that once you've unlocked the Pandora's box of mind-sets, then you've got to change those mind-sets. Let me put this to you, Bill. When you come to the stages that follow, when you come to the architect and act, what's the trick? Actually how do you change mind-sets across an organizations? That sounds like a mighty hard challenge.

Bill Schaninger: Well, I think one of the things that Scott was getting at there is that once you unlock it, you can't unknow it. You have to do something about it. It's also you're not doing 20 of these. In that case, actually really understanding what everyone knows was important, because you'd work on that one.

I spent a ton of time with heavy-industrial companies where capital allocation and capital productivity was important. We discovered that along their seven-step, beautiful process was seven steps of padding.

What it really came down to, when you teased it out, was that it was better to be predictably mediocre than to be usually brilliant and occasionally really wrong. If you were to look at that kind of idea, a normal distribution of performance would be to be aggressive, push for what your really can, drive for value, drive for reliability. Every once in a while, because it's a distribution by math, you're going to have something on the other side of tail, and that should be OK. Because we condition people this way.

No one rolls into your employment and is automatically thinking that way. They're conditioned. You said, ""How do you architect it?"" The essence of architect on the health side in a framing that we call the ""influence model"" is really simple. People have traits. That's who they are. It's their personality. It's their competencies. It's their aptitude. That's all there. Then they go into an environment. That environment is created by you, the people who run the place. Then those two things come together, and it creates a state, and state increases the likelihood that you're going to behave in a certain way.

Now that's the psychobabble part of it. But architect is about creating an environment that dramatically increases the likelihood that you will change how you think and behave. That's why you pick a relatively small number of these: management practices, the ethos you want adopted, stated mind-sets that you'd like to be brought forward. You say, ""OK. What's the best way we know how to change this environment?"" Four pretty simple buckets really help people understand why you're asking them to do what you want them to do, why it's important. And make sure you stick with it until they actually have some conviction.

You don't need people singing from the rooftops right out of the gate. You do need to have enough, though, that when you're not watching, they're going to try it. They're going to do it. Adoption is a big deal. Storytelling is a big part of this, so is making sure that they hear the story with an ear toward something that matters to them, their sense of meaning.

It can't just be about the stock price. For many people, it has to be about customers, the community they're in, their colleagues, their business unit. It might even have to be, ""What does this mean for me?"" There are a whole lot of rules in a workplace: the formal mechanisms, the operating model, the processes, the systems. But in short, it's how resources are allocated, and it's how decisions are made. Who's involved, how fast, and with what repercussions? If you want people to change their behavior and change what they think is important, make it easy to comply. So many times we'll say to people, ""I want you to act like an owner; be entrepreneurial."" Then you force them to get 12 signatures to hire an assistant. That would be inconsistent. That is an early, early proof test for the employees of the organization to look at leaders and go, ""You're actually not serious.""

That's the first two: the understanding and conviction and the formal mechanisms. Then we think about, ""Do they have the skills they need?""Most people look at something and go, ""Well, if I put forth the effort, how likely is it I'm going to get the result that they want and I want? What's the reward I'm going to get or the outcome? And does that mean anything to me?"" Most people don't want to run into brick walls.

They want to believe that the work they're working on is important, is material; the outcomes matter; and, by the way, they have a chance in heck of being successful. The beauty of that, of course, is people also don't want to think it was a Hail Mary pass--in American football parlance. They don't want to think it was chance. If it does work, they want credit for it. They also don't want ""mission impossible."" Find a balance.

Interestingly enough, we talked about formal mechanisms, beyond the process of target setting. The actual target is hugely impactful to motivation, strong enough to be stretched, strong enough to show it's new and matters. But it can't be so far out that people, the minute they see it, go, ""Well, that's not mine."" That's crazy. You have to believe you have a chance.

The last one is role modeling. And this one, actually, between the two books, we've learned quite a bit about because I would say that, historically, we've been disproportionately focused on the value of the cascade, the leader, change leaders. They're still all very important. But, increasingly, as we are a workforce comprised of a generation that has a lot of their actions that are digitally based, we've had to come to grips with the idea that influencers and opinion leaders and people in the social network, their role modeling matters way more.

You still need the formal leader to set out the North Star, but the validation cycles and the encouragement cycles are also coming from these influencers. Being able to know who's in that and who matters, it's a huge deal to generating real role-modeling reinforcement, saying, ""Hey, this matters. We're going to do it. And you should do it, too.""

Simon London: So those four elements of the influence model--understanding and conviction, reinforcement and formal mechanisms, giving people confidence in the skills that they need, and then the role modeling--if you put those four things together, we think we can address a small number of critical mind-sets. It's doable. It's knowable, how to do it.

Scott Keller: It's important that all of those be done in concert. Let me run the analogy of a soccer game--football, to our international folks--and an opera house. Let's say on Friday night, you go to the opera house. During the best part of the performance, a big crescendo at the end of the opera, what do you do in the audience to show your appreciation? Well, you likely give a genteel clap.

Now let's go to the next night. You're at the soccer finals, and your favorite team's playing. They're now tied, and the time is about up. A fullback steals the ball and makes a fullback run and does this amazing crossover toward the front of the goal. And it's this big header, and it doesn't actually go in because it hits the crossbar. But then it bounces off the back of one of the other team's players, and then it's in the goal, and your team wins. What do you do at the best part of the performance? Probably not a genteel clap. You're going to be jumping up and down, throwing your cup, hugging, high-fiving, whatever. What if you had that behavior in the opera house at the best part of the performance? Well, you'd never do it. Why would you never do it? Because the role modeling is totally different. The story around the cultural significance of this event is totally different. By the formal mechanisms, you'll get thrown out of the opera.

In this particular example, you probably have the capability and skills to do either one. But employees during change are caught somewhere between a football stadium and an opera house, and it's a totally confusing place to be. The story says football stadium, but the formal reinforcement and the consequences say opera house. The role modeling says opera house, but then the training I'm getting says football stadium. The idea is to work all four together to make it clear: ""Hey, on this mind-set and these set of behaviors that relate to it, we're in an opera house now, people.""

Bill Schaninger: By social norms, even if you don't have a rule--I mean, in some cases, you have a rule, in some cases you don't have a rule--you've just been told, ""We don't do that around here."" It's unbelievable how, over generations of employees, that impacts how people behave.

Simon London: It's striking me, there's a common theme here around asking people. How do you find out what mind-sets are? You need to ask people. You need to do structured interviews, laddering techniques, these kind of things. But, ultimately, you need to talk to the people to understand what the people are feeling and how they're thinking. You'd have to do that.

Scott Keller: You do. You have to have an approach, a methodology, an expertise, to not just tell them the time by looking at their watch. What gets exciting is, people could never pick the management practices that typically the predictive analytics will show are the management practices to focus on. People typically are not conscious of the mind-sets that are kind of underlying the culture--or the unlocks. When you elevate these, what you get is this really wonderful feeling in the organization. Bill's felt it, too. It's this, ""Finally we've surfaced the real stuff. We're actually having real conversations.

Bill Schaninger: There's one thing I want to add about that because there's a legacy of old human-dynamics consultation, or even some of the old process consultation. A lot of that would've been divorced from the performance side. We used to do a ton of safety work and reliability work in plants. Sometimes you'd find organizations that had allowed themselves to fall into this idea that cost effectiveness was the enemy of safety and reliability. It's the classic false trap. Sometimes you'd start a conversation and say, ""Well, you know, the safest plant is the one that's not running.""

Surely we don't mean that. But we might be really saying, ""We need a plant that's safe, makes products reliably on spec, and actually has an opportunity to turn a fair margin to justify the capital,"" because in those places, it's like a couple billion dollars of capital on the ground. We're just trying to get them to handle that we're not willing to sacrifice, but there is an ""and."" It's not an ""either-or.""

Simon London: That hints at a failure mode here: that even if an organization and senior management accepts they need to be working on the performance side and the health side, they've got to be working at it together. These aren't two separate workstreams with separate teams that aren't talking to each other. Is that something that we see in practice?

Scott Keller: Yes. It absolutely is. And it's a huge failure mode.

When performance is thought of as, ""That's what our business leaders are going to do,"" and health is, ""Hey, can the head of HR sponsor that?,"" and it's run largely as, ""That's the HR stuff, and this is the business stuff,"" that never ends up going well.

Bill Schaninger: Never works.

Scott Keller: Starts out fine.

Simon London: It's all business.

Scott Keller: It's all business. It's an integrated steering-committee approach, sponsorship approach. Again, nothing against HR--HR has a wonderful role to play in all this. But it's not solely the domain of HR, nor is performance solely the domain of the CFO, for example.

Bill Schaninger: In fact, now, when we see the setup, the antennae immediately go up, and we go, ""No, actually, we'd like you to put a BU [business-unit] leader in there with the head of HR. By the way, we'd like the head of talent to be over in those two performance initiatives because, frankly, you have no idea how your people are going to start doing that.""

Scott Keller: In the beginning of these large-scale change programs, there typically is a health team and a performance team working together. By the time you get to that phase three, where you're architecting the program, and by the time you get into the act stage, for sure, it' [truncated for Excel compatibility]"

Drives lasting change at scale for global organizations through digital transformation, operating-model redesign, enterprise agility, and leadership development

August 6, 2020In our previous post, we provided an overview of what companies are doing during the COVID pandemic to stabilize or even improve their organizational health. But one question remains: what can be done to drive these kinds of organization-wide behavior changes during a time of unprecedented change and a shift to remote working?

A proven way to achieve mindset and behavior shifts is the ""influence model,"" a research-based interplay of the four quadrants: understanding and conviction, reinforcement mechanisms, confidence and skill-building, and role modeling. Utilizing interventions across all four quadrants helps create an environment in which employees are likely to change how they think and behave, inspiring people to be fully committed to change.

We have helped clients utilize the influence model across countless transformation programs in order to adopt real change. Programs that employed all four quadrants of the model were 3.6 times more successful compared to those who employed none across various contexts. We feel confident in assuming that the importance of each quadrant is even greater in times of world-wide turmoil.

As a real-life example, we can look at what interventions companies have been putting in place to encourage three sets of behaviors: doing things differently, protecting the core, and motivating through meaning, across the influence model.

Doing things differently, using the situation as an opportunity and innovating frequently, while looking outside:

Protecting the core and instilling speed through anticipation, quick codification of knowledge, and clear roles and responsibilities:

Motivation through meaning and inspiration:

As we move into a stage of reimagining culture in light of COVID-19, the influence model can be a powerful and practical framework to ensure leaders are driving change holistically. The power of framework lies in driving change across all four quadrants, consistently. While the need to do things differently, protect the core, and motivate through meaning are the focus of leading companies now, the influence model should be considered an enduring staple of your organization's change management approach.

February 10, 2025Organizations and their leaders are turning to technology, including generative and agentic AI, to help navigate and solve the unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) they face. But the allure of ease through technology can be deceptive, and as technology evolves, leaders must evolve as well.

The future of work in the age of AI is ""VUCA on steroids."" Adding to today's economic pressures and geopolitical conflicts, no one knows how AI will change the world, nor how humans and AI will work together in the future. In addition, treating AI as just another tool to be implemented may put more stress on this already strained system, especially if organizations do not purposefully address the human aspects.

In this environment, leaders continuously face novel and complex challenges with no easy answers, and it can be tempting to default to tech-enabled, data-driven decisions. Part of gen AI's appeal is that, within seconds, it offers a seemingly straightforward answer to any question at the click of a button. Our brains are wired to prefer simple solutions, and AI caters to these natural tendencies in uncertain times. This deceptive simplicity tempts leaders into the comfort of using simple solutions rooted in past processes to address complex, novel challenges.

This loss of nuance and grey zones invites black-or-white thinking, polarization, and deepening of biases, which are further accentuated by the level of acceleration brought to work and life by AI. Leaders may see less diversity of thought in their workforce and less tolerance for constructive dissent that drives smart decision making and innovative problem solving.

This is not to say that AI deployment should not be pursued. Rather, technology deployment alone should not be the objective; the objective is a more sophisticated and capable organization. To balance these tendencies, leaders and their teams need to consciously grow their leadership capabilities. Instead of letting the organization be led by technology, leading in this new era of work requires investing in human capabilities--in particular, the ability to host complexity--alongside technological implementation.

Leaders can strengthen the ability to host complexity--both their own and their team's--through human-centric leadership. These five concrete leadership practices are a great place to start:

The AI age will shape how all companies operate. The challenge lies in determining how to best use technology, including to truly simplify--without losing the unique value that complexity offers, nor the ability for humans to engage with it.

As leaders define their organization's relationship with gen AI, the practices above can help leaders navigate the potential leadership traps of AI and lean into the ""both/and"" of humanity and technology.

Why prioritize workforce health? Investing in employee health can substantially increase economic returns. Research by the McKinsey Health Institute in collaboration with the World Economic Forum indicates that enhanced employee health and well-being could generate up to $11.7 trillion in global economic value. Organizations that prioritize health often see marked improvements in productivity, reduced absenteeism, lower healthcare costs, and heightened employee engagement and retention. They are better placed to adapt to increased regulatory pressures on workplace health and safety standards and withstand greater focus from investors and the public on how organizations are meeting environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria. Moreover, a healthier workforce is a more resilient and adaptive workforce, more capable of navigating the uncertainties and challenges of a rapidly changing world.

What is the current state of workforce health? Work can and should enhance health, yet it is not doing so for a sizeable proportion of employees. In a McKinsey Health Institute survey of more than 30,000 employees worldwide, only 57 percent reported good holistic health (an integrated view of an individual's mental, physical, spiritual, and social functioning),1
with important differences in holistic health and burnout symptoms found across different industries and demographics. For example, employees who are women, LGBTQI+, younger, or neurodivergent, or who report lower education levels or poor financial status, tended to report poorer employee health outcomes than their counterparts in the survey. This underscores the need for tailored interventions to address and prevent health challenges and tackle the workplace factors that contribute to them.

How can organizations address workforce health? Although there is no one-size-fits-all approach, given that each organization is different and employees have varying needs, there are six ""evergreen,"" evidence-based principles for employers seeking to make a positive impact: understand the baseline health status of employees and the value at stake, develop initiatives for a sustainable healthy workforce, pilot interventions to test and learn, track three to five metrics to measure success, ensure leadership commitment and sponsorship, and embed employee health into organizational culture.

These actions seem simple but are often hard to put into practice. Today, many organizations do not see or cannot measure the benefits of their current investments in employee health. They also don't allocate resources in the most effective way--often, the issue is not how much is being invested but the type of investment being made. Rather than solely addressing the poor health of individual employees, developing a healthy workforce means taking a portfolio approach: addressing ill health and promoting good health, supporting individuals, and creating healthier teams, jobs, and organizational environments.

By making work a place that improves health, organizations can build a strong, productive, and engaged workforce and release greater individual and organizational potential. The choice to demand a healthy workplace is one every employee and investor can make.

There is an urgent need to improve employee health. Stakeholders who take immediate action will reap substantial benefits.

Health is ""more than the absence of disease or infirmity,"" as the World Health Organization (WHO) puts it. Modern concepts of health include mental, physical, spiritual, and social function.2
Today, more than 3.5 billion working adults each spend roughly 90,000 hours (or about 45 years)3
of their lives at work.4
This underscores the workplace's potential to profoundly influence health--not just for the benefit of employees but also for their families and the communities in which they live.

Several trends are impossible to ignore: more people working than ever, an aging population living and working longer, and escalating levels of burnout.5
The current state of the workforce, coupled with these trends, demands a rethink of employee health to avoid a potential crisis for health and business. A healthy workforce is not just a matter of corporate and societal responsibility; it is a strategic necessity and a substantial business opportunity.

The reality that leaders face is stark: failing to prioritize employee health risks creating a sicker, unhappier, and less productive workforce, burdened with higher healthcare costs and diminished productivity. The good news is that, conversely, the path to a healthier workforce can yield substantial returns for executives, investors, policy makers, and other stakeholders, including more robust organizations, vibrant communities, and, ultimately, a healthier society.

This report is a call to action for leaders to recognize that the health and well-being of their employees is critical to the future success and sustainability of their organizations. While small actions taken today can build towards substantial impact tomorrow, many stakeholders are uncertain how to make the required changes in the most effective way.

This report is structured to guide stakeholders on this journey, with the aim of helping them feel empowered and enabled to act. The first chapter outlines the case for investing in a healthy workforce, while the second delves into the current state of employee health and well-being globally, looking at how health varies by industry and by demographic group. The final chapters focus on measurement and first steps, and are particularly geared towards executives, providing leaders with the tools and strategies necessary to implement effective health initiatives.

Investing in a healthy workforce delivers measurable performance gains and benefits for organizations and communities.

The workplace needs to foster holistic employee health. Companies of all sizes are entering a period in which it is essential to manage human capital with the same level of discipline as financial capital as part of their total business strategy. Globally, more than 3.5 billion people will each spend approximately 90,000 hours, or about 45 years, of their lives at work,6
representing a major opportunity for employers to nurture the good health of a substantial proportion of the world's population. Improved health benefits individuals, their families, and broader society, as well as the organizations for which they work.

This briefing describes why investing in workforce health can boost organizational performance, enhance employee outcomes, and offer a substantial return on investment.

The world is changing. People are living and working longer, and their roles are evolving due to shifts in demography, advances in technology, globalization, and geopolitical and climate risks. For example, non-communicable diseases (NCDs), such as cardiometabolic diseases, cancers, substance use, and mental and neurological conditions account for 69 percent of today's global disease burden. In the next 15 years, most of the disease categories predicted to rise will be NCDs, with age-related diseases such as kidney diseases increasing the most.7
Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic created a shift in working trends, launching many organizations into the world of remote work.8
It also accelerated and exacerbated long-standing corporate challenges to employee health and well-being, in particular employee mental health, with reports of burnout rising to almost one in four.9
  Many employers started to actively support and promote brain health--not only to address burnout but also because analytical thinking, a key marker of positive brain health, is one of the most sought-after skills by employers.10

The evolution in lifespan, age-related diseases, what we work on, and how we work will require people to be in better physical and mental health for longer and be more resilient and adaptable to change. The McKinsey Health Institute estimates that investing in holistic employee health could generate between $3.7 trillion and $11.7 trillion in global economic value.11
This equates to approximately $1,100 to $3,500 per person, or 17 to 55 percent of average annual pay. This estimate includes the impact of reduced attrition,12
absenteeism,13
and presenteeism,14
as well as improved employee productivity,15
attraction, and retention. The direct costs of medical treatments have been excluded because public, private, and employer-sponsored insurance options vary by country.

The biggest potential benefits come from enhancing productivity and reducing presenteeism, estimated to be worth $2 trillion to $9 trillion. This is between 54 and 77 percent of the total opportunity identified (Exhibit 1). Many organizations substantially underestimate these potential benefits. For example, companies may struggle to quantify the costs of presenteeism, whereby employees are not working at their full potential, and instead focus their investment cases on reducing direct costs, such as attrition and absenteeism, which are more easily measurable. Yet attrition and absenteeism are estimated to account for only between an eighth and a quarter of the total opportunity.

The case for investing in employee health and well-being applies beyond high-income countries. Investment in employee health could boost global GDP by between 4 and 12 percent, with high- and middle-income countries each contributing roughly half of that total (2 to 5 percent) (Exhibit 2).16

However, average salaries are lower in middle-income countries, so analysis suggests these countries have up to four times as many employees who would benefit: an estimated 2.5 billion employees compared to 636 million employees in high-income countries.17

The data on low-income countries was insufficient to reliably estimate the value at stake or the total number of employees potentially affected, but there is little doubt that employees in these economies would also benefit from workplace investment in health.

Within low- and middle-income countries (LMIC), non-communicable diseases (such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and diabetes) meaningfully influence employee health, well-being, and productivity. Premature deaths due to non-communicable diseases account for 80 percent of deaths in LMICs.18
With limited financial security provided by the state and greater pressure on workers to maintain a stable income and afford healthcare, workplaces in LMICs have a significant opportunity to support good employee health.

Benefits for an organization can vary widely depending on the number, sector, and location of their employees (Exhibit 3). Consequently, when organizations evaluate their investment cases, they need to calculate all the potential benefits, including costs that can be avoided.

Major factors which organizations need to consider as part of their investment case include the following:

Although not included in the calculation of the economic value at stake globally, healthcare claims often account for the majority of an organization's total employee health and well-being costs in countries such as the United States where employee health claims are subsidized by employers. In the United States, employers face an estimated $226 billion annually in absenteeism costs (approximately $1,695 per employee), largely driven by chronic health conditions that could be mitigated through preventive care and health programs.19
Conditions such as hypertension, heart disease, and depression cause substantial on-the-job productivity losses, exceeding $300 per US employee annually.20
Cardiovascular disease leads to the loss of $156 billion in productivity annually.21
US employees with untreated insomnia cost employers approximately $2,280 more per year than those without insomnia because of factors such as absenteeism, presenteeism, diminished performance, and higher rates of accidents and injuries.22

A survey of more than 1,600 employer benefits decision makers in the United States (including C-level executives and human resources/benefits leaders) revealed that employers are preparing for medical inflation, with more than two-thirds budgeting for healthcare costs to grow at three times the rate of inflation.23

Globally, total healthcare costs are expected to continue growing because of cost pressures such as those related to an aging population.24
In countries with universal healthcare, organizations currently avoid most of the direct costs of poor health, but this could change with increasing pressure on healthcare budgets and the tightening of fiscal wallets. For these countries, the goal will likely be to maintain quality and accessibility across health systems while controlling costs. Consequently, companies may be asked to pay for their employees' healthcare, especially if the workplace is found to be a cause of ill health. For example, Japan introduced the Stress Check Program in 2015 to tackle an increasing number of work-related mental health disorders. The program requires workplaces with more than 50 employees to offer an annual stress survey and to facilitate consultations with a physician for those with high stress levels.25

More recently, the Chilean government introduced a mandatory evaluation of workplace environments and mental health in 2024 to promote the accountability of employers for their employees' health. The Chilean Safety Association has taken a leadership role in this policy change by developing preventive medicine, launching affordable mental health for communities, and convening local organizations and leaders to collaborate on mental health (including the development of an annual Mental Health Thermometer).

Supporting employee health does not need to rest on employers alone and can be a joint public and private effort. There is no need for employers to reinvent the wheel: they can benefit from the expertise, infrastructure, and goals of public health stakeholders through partnerships, especially as these stakeholders may offer referral pathways. For example, employers may consider partnering with a private, non-profit, or public healthcare provider to offer on-site employee health clinics with a focus on preventive care. This could include cardiovascular, diabetes, cervical cancer, or mental health screenings that give employees easier access to care without taking paid time off. Employers can also consider one-off events, such as a day of optional flu or COVID-19 shots, eye examinations, or specialist training to prevent back injuries.

While the global investment case for improved productivity and reduced presenteeism offers clear value, calculating the gain or ROI for a specific program within an individual organization can be more complex. The literature demonstrates, however, a correlation between employee well-being interventions and productivity improvements of between 10 and 21 percent.26
Research by the University of Warwick found that happier employees are more productive,27
while a recent University of Oxford study found that happier employees in a call center were 13 percent more productive.28
More high-quality research on the causal links is needed, but these early insights are promising.

Investing in employee health and well-being can boost employee retention. Mercer research shows that companies which foster a ""culture of health"" experience employee turnover rates 11 percentage points lower than those that do not.29

Moreover, investing in employee health and well-being is increasingly important for attracting talent. Research from Saïd Business School finds that for many employees, factors contributing to their well-being--such as mental and physical health, work-life balance, and job satisfaction--are as crucial as traditional incentives such as salary.30
This is especially important for younger generations31
in the workforce, born between 1996 and 2010 (also referred to as Generation Z).32
A McKinsey Health Institute survey of more than 42,000 respondents found that at least a third consider physical, mental, social, and spiritual health resources when choosing an employer, with Gen Z respondents and those with lower mental health scores giving particular consideration to mental health benefits.33

Employers may also wish to consider how to promote the health of older employees. Increases in life expectancy and advances in healthcare will extend working lives: by 2050, about 30 percent of the global workforce will be over 50 years old.34
Governments may raise the retirement age or rethink pension structures in response. Consequently, both public and private sector organizations should expect an increasingly multigenerational workforce and tailor their health and well-being programs accordingly.

Employers' actions are ever more visible to stakeholders. Platforms such as Glassdoor, Indeed, Fishbowl, and Reddit offer employee insights into how organizations treat employees and support their well-being, potentially influencing the decisions of recruits, customers, and investors. Data from these platforms can be harvested to find out how employees may feel and why they quit. For example, a recent MIT study identified toxic culture at the top of a workplace as a meaningful factor in employee resignations.35

Research from the University of Oxford shows a direct correlation between employee well-being and an organization's financial success. Companies with higher well-being scores consistently achieve greater valuations, higher profits, and superior returns on assets. For example, a one-point increase in employee happiness scores was shown to be associated with a $1.39 billion to $2.29 billion increase in annual profits.36
A hypothetical ""Wellbeing 100"" stock portfolio, based on data from Indeed, comprising the top 100 companies in employee well-being, has significantly outperformed major stock market indexes since the start of 2021, demonstrating that high well-being scores are linked to stock performance (Exhibit 4).37

Moreover, today's workforce needs to adjust to new roles and technologies in a shifting job landscape. The rapid pace of technological change can be overwhelming. It can contribute to job insecurity and require employees to continuously upskill and adapt by, for example, focusing more on creativity, problem-solving, cognitive flexibility, and emotional intelligence. The rise of remote working has blurred the lines between personal and professional life, creating a workplace culture that can enhance or harm employees' well-being and productivity. A healthier workforce is a more resilient and adaptive workforce, better capable of navigating the uncertainties and challenges of a rapidly changing world.

Some employers may assess the impact on suppliers and partners when deciding how to invest in employee health and well-being. Prioritizing holistic health is not a task to be undertaken alone, not least because long-term health investment benefits business, the workforce, and society. Healthy individuals are more likely to contribute actively to their local communities--volunteering at the food bank, running for city council, coaching their child's sports team, or shoveling a neighbor's driveway.38

ESG criteria are becoming important aspects of delivering business value. They help to enhance revenue growth, reduce risks, minimize regulatory intervention, and increase loyalty and productivity among employees. According to a 2020 McKinsey global survey, a majority of executives and investment professionals believe ESG programs deliver greater shareholder value and would pay a premium to acquire companies with a strong ESG track record.39

To date, environmental and corporate governance issues have dominated the ESG agenda, but the social pillar--which guides how companies manage relationships with customers, suppliers, communities, and employees--is gaining consideration. Investors are increasingly paying attention to how companies manage employee health and well-being, recognizing their criticality to long-term organizational success. Also, there is growing scrutiny on labor practices, employee satisfaction, support for employees' mental health, and thinking around workforce stability. Companies listed on benchmarks such as the S&P 500 index are now assessed not only on financial metrics but also on employee factors, such as job satisfaction, happiness, stress, and purpose at work.40
Similarly, stock exchanges, including the Hong Kong Stock Exchange, are developing ESG reporting guidelines that mandate disclosures on employee health and well-being metrics, such as working hours, rest periods, and equal opportunities.41

Around the world, governing bodies increasingly recognize the importance of employee health and well-being, and regulatory pressures are mounting. For example, the European Union has introduced stricter standards for workplace well-being, such as the European Framework Directive on Safety and Health at Work, the Strategic Framework on Health and Safety at Work 2021-2027, the Work-Life Balance Directive and the European Framework Agreement on Telework. EU regulations state that risk management within the workplace should encompass stress, thereby requiring psychological risk assessments and appropriate prevention methods.42
In the United States, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) increased penalties for workplace health and safety violations to $15,624 per violation in 2023, with non-compliance leading to hefty fines, lawsuits, and reputational damage.

Adherence to these regulations reduces compliance risks and enhances a company's reputation as a socially responsible entity. There is increasing expectation from consumers, employees, and communities that organizations should be transparent about labor practices, diversity and inclusion, mental health support, and work-life balance. Companies that fail to meet these expectations risk losing their reputation and trust among employees and customers alike.

By prioritizing employee and health well-being, employers can unlock substantial performance gains, achieve a healthier, more adaptable and more resilient workforce, and drive positive change in their organizations and communities. Employers should not wait. Decisive action taken today can secure a healthier, more productive future.

No industry or demographic group is immune to employee burnout, exhaustion or poor health--though some are more affected than others.

With more than half of the working population reporting suboptimal employee health, change is imperative. Today's workers face unprecedented challenges across sectors and geographies. Contemporary threats to health include a rise in mental health disorders and obesity; unmet needs from conditions such as diabetes, cancers, brain health disorders, and cardiovascular conditions; and concerns about how climate change will affect food security, infectious diseases, and access to healthcare.43

A 2023 McKinsey Health Institute survey of more than 30,000 employees across 30 countries44
found that 57 percent of employees globally reported good holistic health45
(physical, social, spiritual, and mental health),46
while a fifth of people reported burnout symptoms.47
Only 49 percent of employees were ""faring well""48
--meaning they had positive scores on holistic health and no symptoms of burnout.49
There are multiple drivers of negative and positive health, but it is clear that the current state of health in workplaces is associated with the choices that employers and societies make. It is within the power of executives to build both healthier workforces and healthier societies. Change is necessary and achievable, with many ways to improve health within employers' control.

Based on the 2023 McKinsey Health Institute survey, this report reveals, for the first time, the state of holistic health across more than 35 industries (Exhibit 5).50
Encouragingly, in only 10 percent of the industries surveyed did more than a third of employees report burnout symptoms. In two-thirds of the industries, however, more than 20 percent of employees said they were burned out, while in no industry did more than 75 percent of employees say they were healthy overall.51

Employees reported higher rates of burnout symptoms and lower rates of holistic health in five industries (reported on their percentage of faring well): accounting, retail, agriculture/forestry/fishing/livestock, shipping/distribution, and arts/media/entertainment/recreation.52
Conversely, industries reporting good holistic health and low burnout symptoms (reported on their percentage of faring well) included human resources, construction, administrative and support services, education, and engineering/architecture. These results reflect a global snapshot of a specific point in time and should be interpreted as a potential opportunity for improvement (see sidebar, ""What was measured""). They do not mean every farmer or artist struggles with health, and neither do they negate any of the hardships a carpenter or human resources executive faces. Instead, this research offers new data points for employers seeking ways to improve employee health.

The data analysis did not reveal clear global trends explaining why certain industries outperform others.53
Nor did any single aspect of health drag down the average of low-performing industries, such as may be expected of jobs that are physically or emotionally demanding. Instead, scores were generally low or high for all four dimensions of health.

The data also returned some examples that run counter to global trends. For example, while the health of front-line workers is generally worse than that of managers, people working in construction report high holistic health.54
In education and administrative support services, employees report low burnout symptoms with high job security, possibly offsetting higher financial instability.

The absence of consistent patterns across industries suggests that for both highly and poorly performing sectors, the drivers of workplace health are multifaceted and not easily attributable to specific roles.

A much clearer story emerges from an analysis of demographic data, such as gender, sexual orientation, neurodivergence, age, education, and income. Responses were not assessed for ethnic diversity because of restrictions in certain countries.55
This report reflects survey responses only; further contextual research is required to understand the underlying causes.56

Respondents who self-identified as women, LGBTQI+,57
lacking a high school diploma,58
neurodivergent,59
or low-income60
reported lower holistic health and higher burnout symptoms compared to other respondents. Notably, these groups make up most of the sample, not the minority.61
Only 20 percent of the employees surveyed did not identify with at least one of these groups--groups that are often underrepresented on executive leadership teams. This report can only report outcomes; more research is needed to understand the reasons behind those outcomes.

Specific demographic findings include the following (Exhibit 6):

Gender: Women were eight percentage points more likely to report exhaustion symptoms than men (46 percent versus 38 percent for men), despite similar holistic health (55 percent versus 58 percent for men) and burnout symptom scores (23 percent versus 21 percent for men). Although women constitute half of the global population, they remain underrepresented at all work levels, regardless of race or ethnicity,62
suggesting a need for targeted strategies to increase workplace inclusivity and reduce exhaustion.

Among the many health conditions affecting women, two notable ones are endometriosis and menopause. Improving access to and effectiveness, delivery, and uptake of treatments and care for those two conditions alone would give an annual boost of $130 billion to the global economy by 2040.63

In the research model analyzed71
for both those aged 61 and over and the youngest working generation, the top two predictors for holistic health are self-efficacy and meaning.72
Drivers of burnout differ slightly: in this research, role ambiguity affects older workers most strongly, while a toxic workplace environment affects younger employees and the overall global cohort most strongly (Exhibit 7).

These disparities highlight the importance of understanding differences across age groups to support longevity in the workplace, because older employees bring valuable experience, stability, and institutional knowledge. Employers play a crucial role in helping employees adapt to longer lifespans by fostering age-diverse workplaces and developing products that meet the needs of younger and older employees. Research suggests that innovative workforce planning, including retaining older employees and making the most of their experience, can enhance organizational performance, while creating age-friendly jobs can help maintain a talented and diverse workforce.73

Educational level: College or graduate-level education correlates with reported higher holistic health and reported lower burnout symptoms. Individuals without a high school diploma were 20 percentage points less likely to report good holistic health compared to those with graduate degrees (50 percent versus 70 percent). Research underscores the critical role of continuous learning and development in promoting overall well-being. Learning, development, adaptability, and self-efficacy are core predictors of holistic employee health and vice versa in the underlying research model.74

Financial situation: The survey assessed employees' financial situations based on financial status,75
financial stability,76
and remuneration.77
Only 41 percent of individuals with poor financial status reported good holistic health,78
compared to 76 percent of those with good financial status. Those reporting low financial stability reported 27 percentage points lower holistic health (47 percent versus 74 percent for financially stable) and more than 30 percentage points more burnout symptoms (38 percent versus 5 percent for financially stable). Remuneration is positively correlated with holistic health. People reporting positively on remuneration were 30 percentage points more likely to report higher holistic health than those reporting less positively on remuneration (70 percent versus 40 percent for lower scores on remuneration), and they also reported fewer symptoms of burnout.79

Job insecurity: 45 percent of respondents with high job insecurity80
reported burnout symptoms compared to the global average of 22 percent. Research shows job insecurity leads to adverse effects in mental health (depression, anxiety, burnout) and physical health (back pain, headaches, high blood pressure).81

Job type: Being a member of upper management82
seems to be both a blessing and a curse: 80 percent of these individuals reported good holistic health, but 24 percent reported burnout symptoms, which is higher than the global average of 22 percent. Front-line workers also reported higher burnout rates (26 percent), driven by exhaustion. The top three factors associated with positive holistic health for managers in this study are self-efficacy, meaning, and belonging. For non-managers, the top three are self-efficacy, adaptability, and belonging.83

More people are working while raising children, and more workers are taking care of adults who require care. Globally, the survey found that 10 percent of employees care for someone with a mental or physical illness in addition to their paid jobs. As the number of caregivers in the workforce grows, their role in organizations becomes increasingly important. Employers can benefit by understanding how caring for oth [truncated for Excel compatibility]"

May 28, 2020It's no secret that during times of change, getting people on board and involved with the transformation drastically increases the likelihood of success. As a result--and rightly so--creating stakeholder engagement plans is considered a staple to change management efforts.

However, traditional approaches to stakeholder engagement are largely subjective and often fall flat. Someone is tasked to create a list of the ""key players"" to involve and assumptions are made on how to engage them based on factors including their assumed level of resistance or support. In doing so, leaders run the risk of failing to recognize highly influential colleagues or engage them unproductively due to a misclassification.

To take a data-backed approach to engaging stakeholders, there are two critical factors to measure: voice and value.

While there are several ways to measure voice, an easy way to do so is to ask employees to identify whom they go to in order to better understand what is going on in the organization. The answers can help you identify those individuals that are ""influencers.""

Getting to the value held in each role requires allocating value to individual roles across business as usual, improvement initiatives and new opportunities for growth. These roles can be directly value generating, value enabling or risk mitigating. The emphasis here is to quantitatively identify a list of critical roles that disproportionately impact the organization's performance.

How you engage stakeholders will vary based on their levels of voice and value:

By segmenting the workforce using voice and value, an organization is able to tailor their change management efforts and increase the likelihood that employees are involved, engaged and supportive.

February 10, 2025Organizations and their leaders are turning to technology, including generative and agentic AI, to help navigate and solve the unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) they face. But the allure of ease through technology can be deceptive, and as technology evolves, leaders must evolve as well.

The future of work in the age of AI is ""VUCA on steroids."" Adding to today's economic pressures and geopolitical conflicts, no one knows how AI will change the world, nor how humans and AI will work together in the future. In addition, treating AI as just another tool to be implemented may put more stress on this already strained system, especially if organizations do not purposefully address the human aspects.

In this environment, leaders continuously face novel and complex challenges with no easy answers, and it can be tempting to default to tech-enabled, data-driven decisions. Part of gen AI's appeal is that, within seconds, it offers a seemingly straightforward answer to any question at the click of a button. Our brains are wired to prefer simple solutions, and AI caters to these natural tendencies in uncertain times. This deceptive simplicity tempts leaders into the comfort of using simple solutions rooted in past processes to address complex, novel challenges.

This loss of nuance and grey zones invites black-or-white thinking, polarization, and deepening of biases, which are further accentuated by the level of acceleration brought to work and life by AI. Leaders may see less diversity of thought in their workforce and less tolerance for constructive dissent that drives smart decision making and innovative problem solving.

This is not to say that AI deployment should not be pursued. Rather, technology deployment alone should not be the objective; the objective is a more sophisticated and capable organization. To balance these tendencies, leaders and their teams need to consciously grow their leadership capabilities. Instead of letting the organization be led by technology, leading in this new era of work requires investing in human capabilities--in particular, the ability to host complexity--alongside technological implementation.

Leaders can strengthen the ability to host complexity--both their own and their team's--through human-centric leadership. These five concrete leadership practices are a great place to start:

The AI age will shape how all companies operate. The challenge lies in determining how to best use technology, including to truly simplify--without losing the unique value that complexity offers, nor the ability for humans to engage with it.

As leaders define their organization's relationship with gen AI, the practices above can help leaders navigate the potential leadership traps of AI and lean into the ""both/and"" of humanity and technology."
"11","A new operating model for people management: More personal, more tech, more human","Asmus Komm , Fernanda Mayol , Neel Gandhi , Sandra Durth","February 7, 2025","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/a-new-operating-model-for-people-management-more-personal-more-tech-more-human","4","The way organizations manage their most important assets--their people--is ready for a fundamental transformation. New technologies, hybrid working practices, multigenerational workforces, heightened geopolitical risks, and other major disruptions are prompting leaders to rethink their methods for attracting, developing, and retaining employees.

In the past year alone, for instance, we have seen more and more companies adopt, innovate, and invest in technology--particularly in gen AI--in ways that have spurred more changes to people operations than we have observed in the past decade.

Many organizations are also taking significant steps to address shifts in employees' expectations about work, pursue greater productivity, and foster greater resilience. In many cases, they are looking beyond previously established people management practices and people function (or HR) operating models and taking a step into the future of people management.

What does that future look like? In our view, it is centered on technology's potential to reshape organizations. In the not-so-distant future, emerging technologies may allow companies to deliver personalized employee experiences, redefine work as a symbiotic relationship between human and machine, and continuously measure organizational health and performance to solve problems before they arise. Furthermore, automation through these new technologies should free up managers' time so they can provide more of a ""human touch"" when interacting with employees--that is, more individualized attention as well as guidance and coaching.

To help codify this vision of the future of people management, we gathered perspectives from more than 100 experts in HR technology, executives from blue-chip companies, academics, and other thought leaders in the people and technology domains. Our conversations with these experts and our own research reiterate the value that strong people management functions can generate: Organizations that excel in both people development and financial performance are four times as likely as peers to outperform financially and one and a half times as likely as peers to remain top tier year on year.

In this article, we explore our new vision of people management, outline the core elements of the operating system required to turn this vision into reality, and suggest concrete steps organizations can take to implement a new people operating system.

In coming years, effective people management will require an increased focus on employee engagement, development, satisfaction, and productivity; more fluid allocation of skills to the most value-adding tasks; and a greater emphasis on human-centric leadership.

Customization is already part of employees' personal lives--from tailored social media feeds and customized workouts to e-commerce and music streaming recommendations. People are now looking for similar personalization in the workplace--that is, coaching support, training, and development opportunities tailored to their unique interests, preferences, and needs.

Organizations will need to elevate their employee experience to address this shift in expectations. Historically, they haven't had the technological capacity to create personalized experiences based on, for instance, language, culture, role, or people's individual preferences. This has been especially true for large, global, matrixed companies. In some cases, organizations have also lacked the required data or ability to integrate data across sources, or it was too expensive to make such personalization possible.

Technological innovation is democratizing the employee experience. The technology solutions are better and cheaper, allowing organizations to collect more data from disparate sources, gain insights, and create new services. For example, in the future, organizations could offer tailored compensation and benefits to employees based on their local market conditions with the click of a button. By delivering more individualized compensation and benefits rather than grouping them by role, organizations would ensure that employees feel valued and rewarded in ways that resonate with their personal and professional needs.

Organizations will also be able to give leaders, managers, and other employees customized road maps for their professional development by taking into account existing skills, skill gaps, current and future organizational demands, and workers' stated career goals. Companies will be better able to tailor the employee experience at critical inflection points in workers' careers--for instance, by offering personalized onboarding communications, customized training programs, and AI-based coaching for individuals and whole teams.

Furthermore, organizations and their people functions can take advantage of improved data sources and analytics to measure how these offerings affect employees' experiences and behaviors. These metrics can be used to foster a culture of continuous improvement (see sidebar ""Improving coaching with AI""). Managers would receive higher-quality information, allowing them to act as true development coaches. The result for employees may be significantly higher engagement, satisfaction, and productivity.

The next frontier of technologies holds great promise for further personalizing the employee experience. Digital twins or individual personal agents could serve as the point of access and interaction for all of an employee's work activities, providing real-time assistance around the clock (see sidebar ""Introducing personal agents"").

Future organizations will need to move past the rigid roles, paths, hierarchies, and silos that often prevent them from achieving their desired business outcomes. Today, employees are too frequently hired for their past experience, not their current skill or skill potential. Companies emphasize promotions over lateral moves, even as McKinsey research indicates that many organizations are losing value by not creating enough internal mobility; more than 80 percent of role moves involve changing employers. And titles, roles, paths, and pay grades still drive status and power in organizations.

Even at the top levels of many organizations, senior management often tries to address leadership gaps while in firefighting mode rather than proactively planning successions over time. Or, they address leadership underperformance too late instead of providing real-time constructive feedback and development support.

In a tech-powered future, people management will be much more proactive, data-driven, and fluid. Organizations will use forward-looking data to understand what's needed to improve organizational health and performance. Strategic workforce planning can happen in real time: Organizations will be better able to anticipate shifts in strategy and, as different capabilities and capacity are required, flexibly match skills to new tasks. They will have the fact base they need to launch interventions such as hiring, insourcing, outsourcing, upskilling, or reskilling. And these interventions themselves will not be one-off activities--rather, the practice of adapting, reallocating, adjusting, and improving will become the norm.

For example, some companies are already using AI to power online marketplaces that give employees information about internal job opportunities. Some of these internal marketplaces are breaking from organizational boundaries and forming broader talent exchanges that give workers a view of opportunities beyond their current employers (see sidebar ""Increasing talent fluidity""). Through this type of ecosystem, organizations can react quickly when skill needs change; in the case of short-term work, they can more easily identify freelance, temporary, or gig workers to handle certain tasks. Of course, this requires the people function to have deep expertise in identifying strategic objectives and translating them into the capabilities required to meet those objectives.

As London Business School economist Andrew J. Scott has said, ""As machines get better at being machines, humans have to get better at being more human.""

This is true for individuals in organizations at large and especially for senior leaders. They will need to shape a new future of work--ensuring that they are leading technology and not being led by technology. To do that, they will need a deep understanding of technology's potential and how to capture that value by using technology in ethical and socially responsible ways.

Managers will need to devote more attention to ""humanness""--that is, providing the empathy, compassion, judgment, and inspiration their employees say they want. They should no longer simply delegate that responsibility to the people function. With more of their time freed up by automation, managers can focus on enabling others to embrace and master the use of new technologies while reducing employees' anxieties about change and technological disruption.

The role of the people function will be to equip managers with the technology, tools, and insights they need to elevate and deliver on their humanness pledge. In the short term, leaders in the people function may need to provide an ethical sounding board for senior leadership on technology usage; they will also need to double down on skill building for leaders, managers, and employees across the organization. Longer term, the people function will act as a thought partner to managers and the senior leadership team, bringing its perspectives on systems, people, technology, and the organization into decision-making.

As these shifts suggest, the next era of people management will require new ways of working and new responsibilities for those in the people function. Specifically, functional tasks will change and will be delivered by people function leaders forming a ""strategic triumvirate,"" the people operating model will be more streamlined, and those in the people function will need to be able to use technology to master complexity to a greater degree than they already do.

The tasks of the future people function will be significantly narrower and more focused on strategy and business. Our research estimates that only about 20 percent of the most strategic activities in today's HR portfolios will remain. We estimate that two-thirds of current HR tasks can be automated to a large degree (Exhibit 1).

Given the scope of automation that can be achieved, the people function will be freer to focus on activities designed to improve the organization, such as developing a higher-performing organizational design and culture and enabling leadership and management. Furthermore, the people function will play a central role in managing change, adaptability, and resilience in a world that is becoming more uncertain and more complex.

On the one hand, the demand for lower- and medium-level-skill roles will decline because of automation. On the other, demand will rise for data and HR technology specialists and for deep subject matter experts in areas such as culture, learning, or leadership and organizational effectiveness. As a result, the people function of the future will be much more expertise-driven and technology-enabled, and people professionals will work in fundamentally different ways: more interconnected, more fluid and project-focused, and more oriented on strategy and business value.

Indeed, the people function will turn from cost center into value-creation leader. It will comprise a new ""strategic triumvirate"" of coaches, subject matter experts, and technologists who will be charged with reimagining how current HR tasks will be delivered:

Our research indicates that more than three-quarters of HR functions are still largely organized along the classic Ulrich model, with HR split into business partnering, shared-services centers, and COEs, or groups focused on specific topics such as learning and development, compensation, and benefits.1

In the future people function, the operating model will need to encompass a leaner, more flexible pool of capabilities, with experts deployed to the most value-driving business priorities, collaborating in product squads. Under this new model, traditional COEs will evolve into virtual practice groups, with people scientists collaborating with other roles on cross-functional priority projects, products, and interventions focused on propelling organizational health and effectiveness. Once a specific outcome is achieved, the squad will dissolve and reallocate to other priorities based on ""skills to value.""

Administrative tasks in shared-services centers will be largely automated, leveraging AI and robotic process automation, and will be delivered by personalized agents. The future shared-services organization will instead own the people and organizational data intelligence engine--managing data and technology platforms, providing insights from data, and steering resources toward the highest value for the business.

Traditional HR benchmarks will need to be reconsidered given the degree of automation possible in the people function of the future. There is no reason to believe that the current average ratio of one people function employee to roughly every 80 employees could not be greatly improved. Ultimately, the people function would have a much larger share of senior team members with expertise-based capabilities, including technology skills.

Most, if not all, of the potential for reinvention of people management and the people operating model hinges on technological advancements. Even with recent leaps in innovation, spurred by increased adoption and investment, there is still a long road ahead for organizations and their people functions. They must continuously upgrade their capabilities to keep up with new technologies. Everyone must become a technologist.

To meet the needs of the people function of the future, organizations will need to invest in an integrated, standardized core data lake comprising a range of critical information on people and business processes. They must also move from a fragmented patchwork of costly point solutions toward a streamlined, fit-for-purpose, cloud-based, AI-powered technology stack (Exhibit 2).

Streamlining the tech stack can eliminate the need to manage multiple complex legacy systems and processes and enable real-time access to people and organizational metrics (see sidebar ""Building a centralized hub."") It can also provide a better user experience for employees by giving them a hyper-personalized entry point to all work-related interactions; applications associated with onboarding, learning, or coaching can be seamlessly integrated under the hood.

As we have just outlined, the people function of the future will be more strategic, collaborative, fluid, and data driven. It will combine the best of human and technological capabilities to consistently deliver positive business outcomes (Exhibit 3).

Based on our research, however, only a handful of organizations (roughly 5 percent of companies) are successfully and routinely incorporating new technologies in their people management functions. Most are still in early stages--defining their strategies, road maps, and design choices, and considering their guidelines and boundaries for the responsible use of data and technologies. Depending on each organization's starting point, we suggest concrete next steps (Exhibit 4).

Across all these archetypes, organizations and leaders should keep the following principles in mind as they move forward:

Organizations are just at the start of a massive transformation in people management--but the time to act is now, as people functions will play a critical role in helping them navigate a more complex and uncertain future. Over the next decade, they must take significant strides toward a value-driven, human-centered, and tech-enabled approach to people management. This will mean overhauling the people operating system to be simpler, more strategic, and more fluid than it is now. Such a transformation will boost organizational effectiveness as well as employee engagement and productivity. Regardless of their starting point, organizations should embrace the opportunities in adopting this powerful new people management model and use it to create value for the business.

"12","Beyond the Rubicon: Asset management in an era of unrelenting change","Pooneh Baghai , Onur Erzan , JuHon Kwek","November 6, 2019","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/beyond-the-rubicon-asset-management-in-an-era-of-unrelenting-change","4","Any question as to whether North American asset management has undergone a fundamental phase shift should have been put to rest in 2018 (and 2019 thus far). The period served up a heady mix of macroeconomic shocks to the financial markets as well as changes in the industry, spurring revenue and profit pressure for firms across the sector (Exhibit 1). While average assets under management (AUM) in North America edged up nearly 7 percent for 2018 to $43 trillion, the industry's aggregate revenue pool gained just 1 percent and, facing a rising cost bill, industry profits fell nearly 4 percent. Net flows for the year were anemic, and the drop in both equity and bond markets late in the year made for a weak fourth quarter and a challenging start to 2019.

The macroenvironment of 2018 was a source of both opportunity and outsize challenge to asset managers. Volatility established itself as an apparently permanent fixture of the new environment, with the markets increasingly feeling the effects of central-bank policy, geopolitical tensions, and frictions in global trade.

A set of now-familiar industry forces continued to redraw the asset-management landscape, and their impact was accelerated and intensified by the stresses of the macroeconomic environment. Six major themes played out in North America over the course of 2018:

The capital markets have been tracking these developments closely and casting their votes through valuations. In 2018 stock prices of publicly listed asset managers hit historical lows--both in absolute and relative terms--trading in a range of ten to 12 times earnings. This modest valuation was a sharp reversal from the baseline of the past ten years, when asset managers earned historical valuations of 14 to 18 times--a meaningful premium relative to the broader financial services sector and even to the market as a whole (Exhibit 5).

In our conversations with market participants and investors, the single most pressing issue clouding the industry is a perception that growth has hit a wall. Some have gone so far as to characterize the new world of asset management in starkly Darwinian terms--as a zero-sum game where growth will come only from the strong taking share from the weak.

While industry flows have indeed slowed across the board and economic pressures are real, it would be a mistake to assume a complete drought of new growth opportunities for individual asset managers. Indeed, 2018 illustrated the power of the macroeconomic environment to put significant amounts of money into motion, including healthy demand for fixed income as a foil against volatility; private markets as a source of idiosyncratic returns; portfolio-level solutions (for example, outsourced CIO and liability-driven investment mandates) to help manage complex liabilities in the face of uncertain markets; and innovative vehicles such as ETFs as tools for intraday risk exposures.

Looking further into the future, we see longer-term fundamentals in place to restore the industry to steady growth. Asset management thrives where three conditions are present: sustained wealth creation, a set of growing retirement needs, and room for the deepening of financial systems.

All of these conditions currently hold in North America. A robust economy and ecosystem of innovation continue to be sources of wealth. A 75 million-strong cohort of baby boomers is beginning to exit the workforce, bringing a new pool of retirement assets and seeking a means to manage them. Furthermore, other societal challenges like climate risk and the infrastructure gap are crying out for financing solutions. And as professional management has penetrated just 25 percent of global financial assets, there remains tremendous room for growth in both developed and emerging markets. Overlaid across all these factors is the reality that investing has become far more complex in the current macroenvironment, making it more challenging for investors to ""do it themselves."" Put simply, the conditions are in place for a new narrative of growth. However, the industry has yet to write it.

The fundamental challenge for the North American asset-management industry is therefore not simply where to find growth, but perhaps more importantly how to manage growth in the context of a multispeed portfolio of businesses, both old and new.

McKinsey's research in the field of corporate strategy suggests that up to 80 percent of a company's growth typically comes from its decisions about ""where to play,"" with the remainder coming from its decisions on ""how to compete."" In the midst of a rapidly transforming industry, asset managers that succeed in pivoting toward areas poised for secular growth will benefit from meaningful tailwinds. Yet even among managers aggressively pursuing these new growth opportunities, most are saddled with a large base of legacy assets for which there is anemic new demand, but nonetheless sustains their franchises.

As an example, the challenges facing actively managed equities over the past few years are well documented, as are the secular factors encouraging outflows. Yet the asset class remains an outsize part of the industry--representing 31 percent of revenues in 2018. And it is not going away anytime soon: Active equities are still expected to account for over 25 percent of revenues in 2023. Sustaining a near-term competitive position amid these shrinking but sizable revenue pools, while investing in new capabilities and pursuing new sources of growth, is a challenge in management dexterity.

These conditions create a classic tension between defending the old and investing in the new. The risk at hand is a self-inflicted ""tragedy of horizons,""1
where near-term pressures to defend profitable legacy businesses create organizational stasis, which inhibits investments in new capabilities, and a structural pivot in business mix and practices in favor of longer-term growth.

Remaining in a defensive crouch trying to weather the storm of structural change is rarely a winning formula. In our view, then, current depressed industry valuations are not signaling a sector with fundamentals that are in inexorable decline. Instead, they reveal a broken connection between old business models and the realities of a new world.

But today's valuations are by no means destiny. While the industry as a whole may have been slow to respond to secular trends, forward-looking firms have laid out decisive plans on where to compete and how to win. The gap between the winners and losers is wide, but the capital markets still recognize and reward growth and profitability.

The investment-management competitive ecosystem continues to evolve with great pace, and asset managers increasingly face the existential questions of who they want to be in the market and how to create value.

Even as the structural shifts in the industry are clear, there is no one-size-fits-all path to success. But there are distinct recipes. We have defined four that we believe will find resonance in the new industry landscape:

Sustained alpha generators set themselves apart through a unique edge in investing and consistent outperformance. These firms build an effective ""flywheel"" of a strong investment culture and a disciplined investment process, which in turn generates outstanding results, attracting clients who understand their philosophy deeply (and thus are willing to stick with them through cycles), as well as top investment talent drawn to opportunities for learning and growth.

However, alpha has been in short supply in recent years and is likely to remain so against a market background of lower expected returns across traditional asset classes. Clients will continue to seek out and reward firms that consistently beat the market: top-quartile firms in this archetype have historically achieved outsize growth in AUM and revenues.

Broad-based scale manufacturers meet a full set of client needs and are well positioned in their cost base by virtue of their size. Firms that embrace this recipe seek to meet a full set of client needs and are well positioned to efficiently manufacture and distribute products across the full range of asset classes. When successfully executed, this recipe enables firms to position themselves as core partners to their clients--a major advantage when many clients are seeking out fewer but more strategic manager relationships.

The key to success in this recipe is simplicity--a client interface that seamlessly delivers the whole firm to clients in an intuitive way and an operating model that delivers capabilities at scale and increases productivity as the firm grows. Top performers in this group have achieved organic growth at approximately double the industry average and the strongest revenue and profit growth. However, the costs of mediocrity in this recipe are high: average performers--those who achieve breadth without scale--struggle to grow and to deliver their offerings at attractive unit costs.

Vertically integrated distributors leverage their control of the full value chain to capture flows. Success with this recipe requires equal measures of skill in product management and industrial engineering. These firms internalize processes from manufacturing to distribution via proprietary ""pipes"" giving them privileged access to end investors or permanent capital--through direct-fund platforms, wealth-management arms, record-keeping platforms, or balance sheets that are owned or ""rented.""

These firms make heavy use of technology--in particular, digital channels--to access clients in a highly scalable way. They also make strategic use of pricing, for example, via fee reductions on established funds and on new products to accelerate customer acquisition with high-visibility loss-leader products.

Solutions providers deliver value through bespoke services designed around clients' long-term, complex investment needs, such as liability-driven investing, outsourced CIO services, strategic asset allocation, and pension-risk-transfer advice.

Results for this group fall in the middle of the four archetypes--average providers achieve results comparable to industry averages, although typically with a stickiness of customer relationships that does not show up in aggregate numbers. That said, top-quartile providers have managed to generate relatively strong net flows, and there seems a clear pathway for this growth to continue given the increasing complexity of client portfolios.

The industry's post-crisis decade of steady revenue growth through market recovery seems to be near, or even past, its peak. For firms to attain growth and high profitability for the next ten years, marketing innovation and investment excellence will be required to capture new sources of demand. Asset-management executives should consider four broad categories of actions in their strategy and competitive positioning:

""If we want everything to remain as it is, everything needs to change.""2

North American asset management has entered a period of unprecedented challenges. New opportunities are available, but in order for the industry's position to stay the same--earning premium growth, profitability, and valuation--everything will need to change."
"13","From crisis management to strategic resilience: Lessons from the auto industry","Dorothee Herring , Manuel Altmeier , Thomas Poppensieker","March 18, 2025","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/from-crisis-management-to-strategic-resilience-lessons-from-the-auto-industry","3","The global automotive industry is at a crossroads. Traditional risk management strategies aren't enough in an era of rapid technological advancements, geopolitical tensions, and supply chain upheavals. Carmakers saw abrupt changes in consumer demand during and after the COVID-19 pandemic and continue to grapple with persistent supply chain bottlenecks and transformative technological trends like electrification and autonomous driving. Geopolitics, with its trade barriers and potential to limit companies' access to critical materials, is making things even tougher. For automakers, the stakes couldn't be higher. It's time to rethink the road map.

Industry players will need to make substantial capital investments even as they face higher risks. Spending on electric vehicle (EV) batteries alone is expected to rise by 27 percent annually, reaching $400 billion by 2030. Similarly, the development of autonomous-driving technology will demand significant investment. Meanwhile, shifts in demand mean the value chain will need to evolve from a more resilient supply chain and sourcing strategy toward a more flexible and trade-resilient production and distribution network--all tied to long-term capital commitments. How quickly these changes are materializing is evident in China's vehicle exports, which, according to data from the China Association of Automobile Manufacturers, were five times higher last year compared with 2020, while exports from the United States and Japan fell.1
Brand perceptions are changing, too, as evidenced by the declining demand for foreign cars in China.2

These challenges have forced industry leaders to rethink their strategies and ask difficult questions: How can we be better prepared for future uncertainties and anticipate disruptions earlier? More important, how do we adjust our approach to reducing risks while staying competitive?

To address these questions, business leaders should adopt an assertive, agile, and strategic approach to risk management, with scenario plans for a wide range of disruptions. Forward-thinking automakers are embedding resilience into every aspect of their business strategy, from investments to supply chain planning. In doing so, they are paving the way toward growth (see sidebar ""Perspectives on the importance of resilience in the automotive industry""). They are also providing comfort to their boards by ensuring that their strategic risk profiles are well articulated, well understood, and commensurate with the company's capabilities and resources. In this article, we explain what they're doing and how others can start doing the same.

Embedding resilience within strategic planning means understanding where and how uncertainties evolve, across which dimensions or areas a company can strengthen its resilience, and then dynamically linking the two in an agile strategic-planning approach.

Disruptions are hard to predict, but business leaders can identify the areas from which they are likely to emerge. The World Economic Forum's 2024 risk report3
highlights trends in technology, the environment, geopolitics, and socioeconomics that can lead to risks. In our view, the automotive industry faces 25 to 30 core strategic risks in these areas. Leaders can assess each of these risks for its impact, likelihood, and ways to limit the fallout. For instance, geopolitical risks affect market access, supply chains, and long-term production stability. Government policies can also affect access to technology, which is part of the growing trend of political protectionism and bargaining. Other risks include demographic shifts, energy transition policies, and changes in economic growth that influence demand for cars and EVs.

Mapping how these strategic risks could affect the organization's strategy can help leaders focus on the most urgent scenarios or those tied to critical strategic decisions. Typically, this analysis should highlight three to four high-priority scenarios each quarter to guide strategic decisions around major investments or changes to existing plans. Forward-thinking automakers, for example, monitor geopolitical developments, such as trade restrictions or tariffs, and establish relevant markers designating when to adjust production so they can access markets and maintain supply chains. They also explore flexible production models to adapt to shifting demand. This is a break from the past when automakers planned sales volume and priced cars according to available production capacity.

Specific risks do not affect just one aspect of an automaker's operations. For example, trade restrictions don't just challenge companies to think differently about production networks; such restrictions force a broader strategic response, touching everything from finances to operations to reputation management.

Most organizations view resilience through six main categories: financial, operational, digital/technological, organizational, business, and reputational. Each has its own subset of risk dimensions ranging from operational stability to strategic competitiveness. For instance, if leaders are considering the operational resilience of their supply chains, the focus might be on keeping specific parts and components flowing. But strategically, they will also need to consider how to design supply chains that can adapt to today's volatile environment--be it geopolitical tensions, trade restrictions, conflicts, or climate-related disasters. In the past, the focus may have been on minimizing supply chain costs in a global free-trade environment. Today, the focus for supply chain leaders must be on planning for flexibility, additional redundancies (backup resources), and strategic sourcing options for rare materials, components, and technology. Each dimension of resilience offers short- and long-term opportunities for targeted improvements and greater organizational preparedness (Exhibit 1).

Through systematic reviews of these resilience dimensions, senior leaders can spot potential opportunities and vulnerabilities. One example in the automotive industry involves the rapid evolution of the software being developed for cars. In this case, two cultures are coming together--the more iterative and error-tolerant software engineering culture and the safety-oriented engineering culture associated with traditional car manufacturing. Given the constant upgrades to automotive technologies, carmakers will need to understand how to combine and integrate new technological skill sets and business models into their organizations--factors that managers often underestimate--and balance them against the economic reputational risks associated with potential technology failures.

Investing in resilience is costly, so prioritizing these investments is essential. Leaders will need to align their resilience initiatives with current and emerging risks. In this way, they can shape their quarterly agendas to include discussions about strategy and portfolio risks.

Consider the regulation of new technologies: For carmakers, managing new regulations and legal precedents on product liability will be critical for realizing advances in autonomous driving and AI. Automakers should weigh the potential benefits of being first movers against the potential legal and reputational risks of early adoption. Similarly, changes to environmental laws will influence the energy transition and its pace. Companies can take three actions to effectively link these and other uncertainties with structural resilience factors.

First, they could imagine the future, going beyond basic sensitivity analyses to consider a wider range of realistic possibilities. These may include low-probability but high-impact events, such as bans on combustion engines. By monitoring regulatory changes, consumer trends, and geopolitical developments, leaders can more easily identify when a scenario is becoming more likely and generate more informed responses more quickly.

Second, automakers could evaluate potential opportunities in these scenarios, applying the following tests to guide their preparedness:

Forward-thinking automakers, for example, benchmark their risk exposure using KPIs across impact and likelihood categories. Supply chain risks might be assessed by country exposure (both direct and indirect, including tier-one and tier-three suppliers) and dependence on single sources. For each significant risk, leaders set targets, establish tracking mechanisms, and define their appetite for risk. In the case of supply chain risks, the targets might include the maximum time an assembly line can remain idle, or the minimum long-term production capacity needed.

Third, it's important to look back after a crisis. When uncertainties unfold, companies should reassess their strategic positions and question whether their original assumptions still hold. A company could adjust strategies in response to structural changes, such as shifts in the energy transition, the rise of remote work, and consumer trends following crises (like the pandemic and the Ukraine conflict).

Incorporating resilience into strategic planning is just the beginning (see sidebar ""Getting started: How to get on the road to strategic resilience""). Companies, especially in the automotive industry, need to build a resilience muscle--that is, they need to develop flexible and strong processes and systems that go beyond traditional static approaches to strategy planning and risk management. What's more, they should be open to challenging past assumptions about their strategies and their own capabilities.

Companies should develop a view of strategic risk on a quarterly or semiannual basis. This risk report should outline the organization's resilience profile and include updates to strategic risk questions. It should present a clear view of risks, prioritized by impact and timeline, and include updated scenario analyses. In this way, the board can ensure that the company's risk profile aligns with its risk appetite and that management can make informed decisions.

The report should test strategic initiatives against a range of different scenarios, not just the usual base, upside, and downside cases. Scenarios that are unlikely but still possible should be included to avoid surprises--for instance, a potential increase in the prevalence of ride-sharing and robo-taxis may mean that fewer customers want to own a car.

Amid the risks, companies should regularly review their resilience capabilities and compare them with those of their competitors. The auto industry regularly contends with issues such as production volume dependency, cost flexibility, and access to materials and technology. Setting specific targets against these factors, tracking them with clear metrics, and benchmarking themselves against others can help automakers manage these risks effectively.

In today's environment, traditional three- to five-year plans often become outdated in a matter of months. By contrast, quarterly reviews and updates allow companies to respond quickly to external developments as well as internal experiences and challenges. When a new scenario emerges, companies will have a set of options in place and action plans ready. Financial planning is a particularly critical area--one that warrants more frequent reviews by automakers, allowing for staged investment decisions and detailed resource allocation.

Companies' resilience needs to be regularly tracked with KPIs and key risk indicators (KRIs). Some automakers, for instance, rigorously monitor potential supply chain risks created by their reliance on single suppliers or exposures in certain countries. They track key metrics associated with these risks, update senior management, and intervene if there are significant changes. Indeed, these KPIs and KRIs should be linked to the company's costs and the probability of disruption.

Today's finance models and planning tools enable detailed budgeting and resource allocation. However, they often overlook how strategic risks can affect the organization. A strategy-oriented planning model for risk and resilience should consider important risk factors across the organization--from the supply chain to procurement to production and sales. These are typically expanded models, built in collaboration with the finance team, and they can help leaders assess risk scenarios and make informed decisions. For instance, learning from past disruptions, some carmakers have adopted 24- or 48-hour timelines as a benchmark to respond to disruption. During this time, they can assess the impact from, say, a sudden loss in sales or supply chain shortages caused by geopolitical events.

The quest to build a resilience muscle starts in the executive suite and boardroom (Exhibit 2). Leaders should question long-held assumptions, encourage critical and challenging discussions, and allow for regular review and adjustment. The ability to adjust and quickly correct strategic decisions is arguably the most important factor in building organizational resilience.

It's equally important to ensure that middle managers understand the shift from fixed strategy and execution cycles to a more agile approach. They, alongside senior leaders, should encourage regular communication and constructive feedback with employees across the organization. Disruptions and the need to make strategic adjustments will only become more frequent, given higher market volatility and changes to the structure of the industry--such as the shift from gas-powered vehicles to EVs. Automakers should ensure that their employees are aware of these shifts and prepared to respond quickly. Training programs and frequent communication about the need for resilience can help everyone understand why changes are necessary and how they contribute to helping the company stay competitive.

While senior leaders may have some of these practices in place, relying on traditional approaches isn't enough to build a resilient automaker--or any company operating at global or international scale today. The stakes are higher and uncertainty is growing, yet resources and management capacity remain limited. Temporary task forces can help handle immediate disruptions, but they can also exhaust the organization over time. Even the most capable leaders will find it harder to stay competitive without a more systematic approach.

In the long run, resilience will be the key factor that distinguishes industry leaders from those that fall behind. To grasp the necessity of resilience, leaders need only look at past disruptions, such as the financial crisis. As changes become more frequent and wide ranging, developing a robust resilience strategy will become even more critical for achieving success.

"14","The looming advisor shortage in US wealth management","Jill Zucker , Jimmy Zhao , John Euart , Jonathan Godsall , Vlad Golyk","February 10, 2025","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/the-looming-advisor-shortage-in-us-wealth-management","3","Following several years of economic crosscurrents and fluctuating performance, the US wealth management industry is entering 2025 from a position of strength, with solid fundamentals in place. Demand for its services continues to grow as Americans become wealthier and their needs become more complex--for example, because of greater reliance on personal savings for retirement than in prior generations and the proliferation of sophisticated financial products to maximize wealth accumulation and preservation. This increasing demand is illuminated by clients' growing willingness to pay for human-delivered advice.

There are, however, clouds on the horizon: questions concerning adequate supply for this healthy demand. We estimate that by 2034, at current advisor productivity levels, the advisor workforce will decline to the point where the industry faces a shortage of roughly 100,000 advisors.

Addressing this gap requires changing the advisor operating model to increase productivity (through lead generation, teaming, and an AI- and technology-enabled shift toward value-adding activities) and attracting new talent to the industry significantly faster than before. Successfully navigating the broad challenge would not only benefit the industry economically but also align with the mission of helping American families steer through the complexities of their financial lives.

In this article, we examine the growing demand for wealth management services, detail the looming shortage of advisors, and discuss what companies can do to put the advisor population on a more sustainable trajectory.

Over the last decade, advice revenues have been the main economic driver of the US wealth management industry's growth. In fact, we estimate that revenues generated from fee-based advisory relationships (a proxy for advised relationships) have grown from approximately $150 billion in 2015 to $260 billion in 2024 (6.4 percent CAGR), and growth in the number of human-advised relationships has outpaced population growth by three times in the same period (1.8 percent versus 0.6 percent CAGR in 2015-24).1
Looking ahead, the number of advised relationships will continue to grow; we estimate it could reach 67 million to 71 million by 2034, a 28 to 34 percent increase from 53 million relationships in 2024.2
Several underlying drivers are behind this growth:

This robust demand has not gone unnoticed. Firms across delivery models have been rolling out new advice propositions; for example, traditionally digital/direct wealth managers are rapidly expanding their full-service advice offerings. They have also been enhancing the depth and breadth of their planning services, such as basic financial, philanthropy, tax, family governance, trust, and estate. Some large wealth managers have launched career development programs; however, firms must do even more than they already are to upskill their advisors and improve talent attraction efforts.

Historically, the industry has been able to meet rising demand by making slow but steady gains in advisor numbers and productivity. However, capturing the advice opportunity will be more difficult as the advisor population ages and their numbers start to decline, and as the immediately accessible productivity gains are realized.

The looming advisor shortage should come as no surprise to the industry. The advisor workforce has grown at a meager 0.3 percent per year in the last ten years (Exhibit 1). The outlook is even more challenging: Advisor head count is projected to decline by about 0.2 percent annually.5
Retirements outpace recruitment, as advisors are on average ten years older than members of similar professions. An estimated 110,000 advisors (38 percent of the current total), representing 42 percent of total industry assets, are expected to retire in the next decade.6

Overall, based on historical and projected trends of population growth, wealth creation, and usage of human-advised services, our estimates suggest the industry could face a shortage of 90,000 to 110,000 advisors, or 30 to 37 percent of current head count, by 2034 at current productivity levels.

To date, the industry has answered the rising demand with productivity initiatives enabling advisors to serve more clients. These initiatives include advisor teaming; hiring of specialists to support advisors; rollout of digital account opening, reporting, and self-service (for example, updating basic account information, adding a dependent, requesting a wire transfer); and enhancements to advisor desktops and workflow automation (such as portfolio implementation and rebalancing). Continuing to increase advisor productivity will require the systematic application of an even broader set of levers, as most quick wins have been realized.

Without resolving this fundamental supply bottleneck, the industry will continue to find itself in a zero-sum competition for advisor talent. In fact, as competition for experienced advisors grows--in part, fueled by private equity investments in the registered investment adviser (RIA) model and growing awareness of the impending shortage--recruiting packages and associated expenses have been on the rise as firms compete for the approximately 27,000 advisors who switch firms or go independent each year. While experienced-advisor recruiting is critical to the success of many firms, the industry should also take a long-term view and develop sustainable strategies to attract more advisors to the industry, help them grow faster, and enable established advisors to be more productive.

Solving the advisor capacity challenge will require a deep rethinking of the advisor operating model. Firms will need to increase productivity by 10 to 20 percent and attract new talent to the industry at a faster rate: 30,000 to 80,000 net new advisors over the next ten years, compared with 8,000 in the last ten years (Exhibit 2). All told, if the productivity gains are realized, the industry will need between 320,000 and 370,000 total advisors to meet demand by 2034.

This is the fundamental challenge wealth managers are facing. Addressing it will require a holistic approach that includes enhanced recruitment (targeting both inexperienced and experienced hires), a redefined advisor operating model with greater productivity, and well-designed succession solutions (Exhibit 3).

Two segments in particular represent the best options for attracting new advisors: entry-level talent and career switchers. In both cases, improving the value proposition of a career as an advisor will be critical to success.

New, inexperienced hires are an important and increasingly diverse talent pool. Women, who are becoming the primary decision-makers for more US families, are underrepresented in the advisor population, according to our annual North America Wealth Management Survey. Firms that recognize this and take steps to attract more female advisors will have a competitive advantage. In addition, each year, more than three million undergraduate and one million graduate students enter the US workforce, with women accounting for nearly 60 percent of the graduate pool7
(versus 15 percent of the current advisor population).

Today, only a few large wealth management firms pursue on-campus recruiting, structured internships, and rotational programs to attract top talent. Partially as a result, financial advisor does not seem to be a top-of-mind profession for most students. Some progress has been made; for example, the CFP Board in September 2024 launched a campaign aimed at promoting financial-planning careers to high school and college-age students. Still, more can be done.

Peer industries, like investment banking, consulting, and increasingly, private equity, have institutionalized recruiting for internships and entry-level jobs from top undergraduate and graduate programs. These similarly high-paying industries offer a clear value proposition and career path for entry-level roles. Meanwhile, wealth management's predominantly sales-based commission model makes the industry less appealing and sometimes daunting for many young recent grads. Models that can help attract a broader spectrum of talent include reimagining the entry level (for example, as a team member versus as a solo practitioner), developing clearer career pathways, articulating the near- to midterm career value proposition, and ensuring a competitive level of guaranteed income at the outset. The resulting talent pool can be enrolled in rotational programs for better-matching career paths (business development, service-oriented, or specialist roles) and, in turn, a better success rate. Wealth managers who are a part of larger financial institutions can improve partnerships with other business units (say, investment banking and asset management) on rotational programs to attract, retain, and develop talent across the enterprise.

Wealth management firms should also not shy away from hiring junior advisors exiting one of the major advisor development programs. In many cases, individuals who ""dropped out"" simply may not have found the right fit at a given firm--for example, pursuing more sales instead of being service oriented. These candidates could excel in a different firm and culture and may have already obtained the requisite licensing and basic training.

US direct brokerage platforms are a bright spot in the talent arena, having shown early signs of success with a more bifurcated sales and servicing approach. All told, our analysis suggests that these firms have trained over 5,000 new advisors in the last five years. These platforms are emerging as leading talent developers, particularly with a new breed of advisors: young Certified Financial Planners (CFPs) focused on client service rather than sales. One direct brokerage, for example, added about 300 additional CFPs to its ranks in 2023, a 100 percent increase.8

Beyond recent graduates, firms should look to tap new sources of talent. Career switchers can be divided into three distinct--but sometimes overlapping--segments, each with intrinsics or expertise required to be a successful advisor. These segments include adjacent financial services professionals with client service experience (for example, CPAs, trust and estate professionals), professionals from other industries with strong consultative sales skills (such as software sales), those with strong relationship skills (say, white-glove client service reps, executive assistants, and veterans). Additionally, wealth management companies can do much more to tap the skills and experience of women looking to change career paths. Wealth management firms with bifurcated sales and service models are better positioned to accommodate a broader range of talent profiles and skill sets. And establishing clear roles that cater to either entrepreneurial or empathetic profiles can attract a broader set of potential advisors.

Recruitment is unlikely to be enough. To address the advisor shortage, wealth managers must continue to invest in and increase the productivity of all advisor segments. The industry has made some progress in this direction, but a deeper rethinking of the advisor operating model and allocation of time is necessary.

In particular, the industry needs to significantly improve lead generation, teaming, and practice management (optimizing skills of team members, increasing specialization and leverage), and the use of technology enabled by gen AI (a focus on value-add activities and removal of tedious, low-value tasks). We estimate that these levers can increase advisors' capacity industry-wide by 10 to 20 percent on average over the next ten years, equivalent to adding 30,000 to 60,000 advisors at 2024 productivity levels (Exhibit 4).

Centralizing lead generation could free up 3 to 4 percent of advisor capacity by reducing the amount of time advisors spend on prospecting for new clients. The impact would be even greater for early- to mid-tenured advisors, who spend an average of 50 percent more time on prospecting than established advisors do on prospecting. On average, advisors currently spend approximately three hours per week prospecting for new clients.9
Prospecting activities include creating a social media presence, developing marketing collateral, hosting webinars and dinners, networking, screening prospects, generating proposals, and closing clients.

Aiding advisors with prospecting can involve several approaches across the sales funnel:

Regardless of the methods a firm chooses, a more thoughtful and innovative approach to lead generation can improve profitability, support recruitment, and provide access to new sources of talent:

Advisors working in teams inclusive of specialists not only are more productive but also tend to grow faster, create deeper relationships, and achieve greater asset retention and customer satisfaction ratings. Advisor teaming creates value in several ways: optimizing use of skills, establishing mutual accountability, clarifying and improving career pathways and development of younger advisors, increasing leverage, co-managing relationships, enabling specialization, better navigating intergenerational transfer, and establishing clear succession plans, ultimately facilitating a more robust client service model.

Teaming benefits are especially pronounced for attracting, developing, and retaining new advisors. Many mid-tenure advisors attribute their success in early years to mentoring and apprenticeship provided by senior advisors. Greater specialization within teams also helps, as new advisors can follow their passion, whether it is planning, asset gathering, or other aspects of the work. At the same time, younger advisors are more likely to adopt new tech solutions and, in turn, boost adoption among the more established and potentially tech-wary advisors on their team, making them more productive.

According to PriceMetrix by McKinsey, advisors on teams tend to have practices that are about 20 percent larger than those of solo advisors. Currently, 59 percent of wirehouse and national/regional broker-dealer advisors work on teams. When extrapolated to apply to the broader industry, continued adoption of team-based models could unlock 3 to 6 percent of advisor capacity, assuming 25 to 50 percent of solo advisors switch to a teaming model.

In addition to teaming, firms should explore more centralized specialist profiles (for example, tax, insurance, legacy planning) and support roles (account opening, money movement, inside sales) to help maximize advisor time spent with clients. Unlocking this capacity will not be easy because most advisors open to teaming are already on teams. However, with the right infrastructure (particularly practice management support), management focus, incentives, and new talent, significant gains are achievable.

Gen AI could be a once-in-a-generation opportunity for wealth managers to increase the productivity of their advisors. It is already being deployed in the industry to create and synthesize meeting notes, draft financial plans and client proposals, support compliance reporting, and serve as a virtual assistant.

According to our estimate, even a 30 to 40 percent average advisor adoption of more wealth-management-specific gen-AI-enabled tools and processes across the value chain and across the full advisor population by 2034 can deliver 6 to 12 percent of time savings--and, in turn, increase advisor capacity. Gen AI can have an outsize impact in areas such as the following:

Beyond gen AI, firms can improve advisor desktops and client experience, automate manual processes, and streamline the advisor workflow. Tech innovation and workflow automation can integrate point solutions and foster development of intuitive advisor workflows, reducing the need for advisors to switch across multiple screens, manually enter data, and deal with servicing issues. We estimate that these enhancements can unlock an additional 1 to 3 percent of advisor capacity.

Succession planning does not contribute directly to the growth in advisor capacity, but it is critical for retaining assets and scaling the practices of the next generation of advisors. Currently, 32 percent of investors switch firms when their existing advisor leaves for retirement or other reasons, according to our survey of affluent and high-net-worth investors.

To improve the retention of client assets, wealth managers can adopt two approaches:

The industry is facing a monumental challenge--addressing a 100,000-advisor capacity shortage over the next ten years--with no easy solution. Wealth managers will need to focus on attracting new talent to the industry, helping them be more productive and successful, and further increasing productivity of the mid-career and established advisor population. Meeting the growing client demand would not only benefit the industry economically but also help it fulfill its mission of helping American families secure their financial futures.

February 10, 2025Organizations and their leaders are turning to technology, including generative and agentic AI, to help navigate and solve the unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) they face. But the allure of ease through technology can be deceptive, and as technology evolves, leaders must evolve as well.

The future of work in the age of AI is ""VUCA on steroids."" Adding to today's economic pressures and geopolitical conflicts, no one knows how AI will change the world, nor how humans and AI will work together in the future. In addition, treating AI as just another tool to be implemented may put more stress on this already strained system, especially if organizations do not purposefully address the human aspects.

In this environment, leaders continuously face novel and complex challenges with no easy answers, and it can be tempting to default to tech-enabled, data-driven decisions. Part of gen AI's appeal is that, within seconds, it offers a seemingly straightforward answer to any question at the click of a button. Our brains are wired to prefer simple solutions, and AI caters to these natural tendencies in uncertain times. This deceptive simplicity tempts leaders into the comfort of using simple solutions rooted in past processes to address complex, novel challenges.

This loss of nuance and grey zones invites black-or-white thinking, polarization, and deepening of biases, which are further accentuated by the level of acceleration brought to work and life by AI. Leaders may see less diversity of thought in their workforce and less tolerance for constructive dissent that drives smart decision making and innovative problem solving.

This is not to say that AI deployment should not be pursued. Rather, technology deployment alone should not be the objective; the objective is a more sophisticated and capable organization. To balance these tendencies, leaders and their teams need to consciously grow their leadership capabilities. Instead of letting the organization be led by technology, leading in this new era of work requires investing in human capabilities--in particular, the ability to host complexity--alongside technological implementation.

Leaders can strengthen the ability to host complexity--both their own and their team's--through human-centric leadership. These five concrete leadership practices are a great place to start:

The AI age will shape how all companies operate. The challenge lies in determining how to best use technology, including to truly simplify--without losing the unique value that complexity offers, nor the ability for humans to engage with it.

As leaders define their organization's relationship with gen AI, the practices above can help leaders navigate the potential leadership traps of AI and lean into the ""both/and"" of humanity and technology.

"16","Harnessing revenue growth management for sustainable success","Brian Henstorf , Pieter Reynders , Sheldon Lyn , Stefano Zerbi","December 18, 2024","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/growth-marketing-and-sales/our-insights/harnessing-revenue-growth-management-for-sustainable-success","3","The economic disruptions from the COVID-19 pandemic and high inflation changed the way consumer-packaged-goods (CPG) companies achieved sales growth. Prior to 2020, pricing and volume propelled sales growth, with pricing as the leading factor. However, a sustained period of high inflation spurred a much greater shift toward price-driven growth, with volume declining or staying relatively flat for the vast majority of consumer goods categories.

Now, as inflation may be reverting to long-term norms, the pendulum is starting to swing. Adjusting prices is less of a guaranteed path to growth. In fact, retailers are beginning to increase promotions to help cover volume losses. Yet volume growth remains elusive, especially with consumers continuing to trade down and swap brands for private labels. This changing landscape is challenging for businesses looking to sustain growth by finding the right balance between price and volume.

Companies looking to navigate these uncertainties can reboot their approach to revenue growth management (RGM). Of the four levers of RGM--pricing, promotions, assortment, and trade investment--companies have largely focused on the first, taking a relatively blunt approach of increasing headline prices during inflation to drive net-price realization. But now, a more nuanced approach using all four levers could serve companies better, and increased sophistication is required.

In this article, we first describe the price elasticity that CPG companies have seen in recent years. Then we make five recommendations for business leaders: setting grounded long-term aspirations, deeply understanding consumer behavior, deciding which RGM levers to pull, engaging retailers in new ways, and improving tech capabilities. By following these steps, businesses can position themselves for success in a rapidly evolving market and for better management of changing pricing dynamics.

In the years leading up to 2020, most consumer goods companies reliably delivered mid-single-digit net-sales growth. According to our analysis of the top 32 publicly listed CPG companies, this growth was driven slightly more by price than by volume. In 2020, growth stagnated as a result of the pandemic. In the 2021 boom, both price and volume rose about 3 percent. In 2022, the pendulum swung heavily. Hyperinflation pushed prices up by more than 10 percent, volume decreased, and yet overall net sales remained high because of the steep price increases. In 2023, inflation reduced somewhat, decreasing net-sales growth, but volume didn't return. So far, 2024 is delivering much lower price growth and continued volume declines (Exhibit 1).

Not surprisingly, this swing toward price dominance in sales growth has caught the attention of analysts and investors who are sensitive to volume losses, given category volume declines. Company executives tell us that they have sought to reassure investors of their intention to plot a path to a more balanced and sustainable mix of price and volume-driven growth.

With shaky total shareholder returns in recent years in the CPG sector, investors are rightly uneasy about whether companies can spur higher growth rates by balancing price and volume. Whether they raise concerns about price elasticity increasing again or retailer pushback on price increases as commodity costs turn more favorable, the broad consensus is that managing pricing in the coming months and years won't be easy. As inflation recedes, so does the potential of the pricing lever.

More sophisticated RGM capabilities beyond pricing will be critical to continue to drive net-price realization and growth. Companies can improve their odds of delivering more balanced net-sales growth by reactivating the full range of RGM levers to adjust prices, expand higher-margin items in their portfolios, and maintain or increase overall volume. Here are five areas of focus they can consider.

Globally, central banks are indicating a potential soft landing for the economy, suggesting that inflation could return to prepandemic levels within a couple of years. The US Federal Reserve forecasts annual inflation of 2.6 percent in 2024, falling to 2.3 percent in 2025, and stabilizing at 2.0 percent in 2026. The European Central Bank estimates a similar reduction in inflation over the same period: 2.5 percent in 2024, 2.2 percent in 2025, and 1.9 percent in 2026.

While no one knows exactly how things will play out, these projections provide a useful reference point for CPG companies planning price realization strategies over the next three years. If inflation does indeed hover around 2 percent, these companies should expect to return to a 2 percent price-mix realization coupled with a modest volume increase of another 1 to 2 percent, depending on the growth dynamics of the category. Top-performing companies that excel at RGM strategies and implementation will aim to beat this baseline scenario.

Companies should view incremental net-sales growth explicitly as a function of the specific advantages they enjoy in their respective categories. These advantages might include a superior brand that's less price sensitive, a distribution footprint skewed toward high-growth channels, or a presence in high-growth subsegments. Additionally, explicit actions--such as innovation with new product launches, incremental distribution with more SKUs in existing channels or existing SKUs in new channels, and greater marketing effectiveness--can help companies outperform the baseline.

Even with positive macroeconomic indicators, companies should pay close attention to trends in consumer and household sentiment and behaviors. According to consumer price index data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, US inflation was 2.7 percent in November 2024, compared with its peak of more than 9.0 percent in June 2022. The cost to feed a family of four is now 51.6 percent higher than prepandemic levels, heavily outpacing disposable income growth, which has risen by 30.3 percent in that same period.1
And although, in September, the Federal Reserve announced its first interest rate cut in more than four years, interest rates are still well above prepandemic levels, and personal monthly interest payments are up 50.1 percent.2
A recent McKinsey ConsumerWise survey shows that although US consumers have grown a bit more optimistic, they remain cautious about spending. They're cutting back, changing to discount retailers, shifting to private labels, or simply delaying purchases, with 74 percent of US consumers changing their shopping behavior to trade down (Exhibit 2).

To ensure that RGM strategies are effective, companies should develop a deep understanding of how core consumers might respond to any price-related move. Aggregate views should be unpacked by category, consumer segment, and brand. For example, a given consumer segment might abandon its favorite brand and switch to private-label spices at primary grocers, or it may choose not to abandon the preferred brand and instead go to club retailers and upsize for a lower price per ounce or kilogram. Consumer behavior is differentiated; people may choose to save in some categories but increase spending in others. The more a company is able to understand what its consumers think and how they behave, the more precisely it will be able to calibrate any pricing and RGM changes.

Many companies may set ambitious net-sales-growth targets to exceed the baseline case, but fewer have a clear plan for success. That said, there are enough arrows in the RGM quiver for companies with the right know-how to improve their odds. Using the right RGM tactics--in the right proportion, for the right brand, and on the right channel--helps set companies apart (table). There's a premium to capture by getting this right. Companies that use RGM to achieve net-price increases with the most muted price elasticity effect or to outperform in volume growth will likely have a distinct competitive advantage.

At a high level, companies should start by understanding the relative net elasticity effect of a given ""net price"" action. For example, a 10 percent increase in manufacturer's suggested retail price (MSRP) has a more tangible impact on a consumer than an equivalent increase derived from optimizing promotions, focusing on higher-end products to encourage higher margins, or resetting trade terms with retailers. All the latter actions deliver net-price gains--but with less impact on consumers.

RGM tactics are strategically tailored to how consumers perceive their value and impact. For example, direct pricing changes, such as increasing the MSRP, affect what people pay at checkout. These price adjustments are highly noticeable and can influence purchasing decisions immediately.

Other tactics such as altering pack sizes, reducing the frequency of promotions, or shifting the product mix toward premium items might also be noticed by consumers, but they generally have a slightly lower perceived impact. These changes influence consumer behavior more subtly, often by affecting perceived value rather than outright cost.

Behind-the-scenes strategies such as optimizing sales channels or reducing nonproductive trade investment have the least impact on consumer perception. These actions are designed to maintain or enhance profitability without making obvious changes that would draw consumers' attention, thereby preserving a sense of value and stability.

Whether these various tactics achieve desired outcomes depends on factors such as underlying category dynamics, strength of a given brand, and a company's execution capabilities (Exhibit 3). No plan fits all: companies that straddle multiple categories and brands will need to tailor their own solutions, involving precise price points, promotional investment, and distribution channels.

Effective data strategies and AI can help companies navigate the complexities of consumer behavior and market dynamics, and even develop recommendations that encourage both price realization and volume growth. However, many CPG companies struggle with implementing the right technology. Consider what it might take to develop the right MSRP recommendations to help a hypothetical brand achieve above-inflation price realization while increasing volume. This brand might feature 30 different SKUs across pack sizes, product formats, and categories. Each SKU could have unique competitive strengths, regional selling dynamics, cross-channel shopping behaviors, elasticities, switching tendencies due to price changes, and promotion responsiveness at different price points. Getting to the optimal granular solution would entail considering hundreds, if not thousands, of scenarios. This cannot be done successfully without high-accuracy predictive and automated technology, supported by robust shopper analytics.

To illustrate the power of advanced tech solutions, consider a real-life example. A food company set prices based on its own brand elasticities, using shopper analytics to estimate the outcome of pricing decisions. However, it found that actual buying behavior differed significantly from its pricing simulations, making the approach ineffective. As a result, the company decided to increase the sophistication of its methodology in two ways.

First, it added new shopper analytics that assessed switching behavior between SKUs. The company discovered that a significant part of the volume losses for a SKU was flowing back into its own portfolio through other SKUs and brands. The switching analytics enabled it to understand net portfolio elasticity from portfolio price changes, rather than just the elasticity of individual SKUs (Exhibit 4). This also changed the company's view of its competition. In many cases, the SKUs with the highest switching rates were not from expected competitors.

Second, the company developed a high-accuracy, AI-enabled predictive and prescriptive simulator that suggested portfolio pricing changes based on optimization under constraints--for example, to maximize profit while maintaining market share, the company's RGM analyst can ask the simulator to propose pricing changes for all SKUs in the portfolio. The company can now make thousands of tech-powered simulations in seconds, significantly improving both the impact of the price changes and the accuracy of the prediction while reducing the time spent on pricing analyses.

Advanced tech solutions are also being deployed to assess the longer-term impact of promotions on household penetration, rather than narrowly deriving short-term promotional ROI from incremental sales during a promotions period. By aggregating myriad data sources--such as loyalty, syndicated point-of-sale, and social sentiment--machine learning and AI can discern patterns that help companies develop recommendations that get closer to efficient promotional spend. For example, through strategic partnerships that gave it access to anonymized retailer loyalty data, a leading CPG company increased its household penetration by redeploying funds from subsidies for brand loyalists to product trials for nonusers.

Generative AI (gen AI) also adds an exciting new layer of possibility, particularly in aiding the adoption of RGM technologies. Gen AI can deliver tangible short-term benefits for RGM, such as streamlining how RGM analytics are presented to the many stakeholders responsible for sanctioning and executing RGM decisions or speedily crafting more engaging, resonant sell-in stories for retailers. Companies are already beginning to explore these opportunities, enabling more effective RGM processes.

Getting the right technology in place is just part of the answer. Most CPGs struggle to scale from an initial pilot to an enterprise capability. Implementing sustainable RGM digital and AI capabilities requires a comprehensive approach that goes beyond technology, focusing also on key enablers such as data integration, cross-functional collaboration, and change management practices.

The dynamic between consumer goods companies and their retail counterparts creates a healthy tension that leads to efficient outcomes for consumers. However, this tension can also prove challenging. For example, retailers are significantly increasing promotions on key value items. CPGs often view these promotions as destructive to category value. Two ways for CPGs to proactively move away from these clashes are retail media networks (RMNs) and data acquisition.

First, most major retailers now operate substantial RMN businesses, advertising products and brands on their e-commerce platforms. CPGs are spending millions on these networks. However, sometimes there's little visibility between the sales team negotiating pricing and trade terms and the marketing team negotiating media spend on RMNs. To get a holistic view on their commercial spend, leading companies are beginning to integrate these teams. Now is an opportune time to engage retailers on ways to connect pricing more optimally to RMN activation. For instance, combining a CPG company's RMN budget with its promotions budget to run integrated omnichannel, multimodal campaigns could harmonize online ads with in-store promotions and provide greater visibility into the incremental lifetime value of a consumer. This is a promising avenue for consumer goods players to pursue.

Second, many retailers are now de facto data vendors. Take, for example, Walmart's Luminate venture or British grocer Tesco's dunnhumby, both data analytics platforms that preferred vendors can use to understand how shoppers shop. Vendors can see their performance against category performance and learn whether they're gaining or losing share compared with their competitors. CPG companies should be getting ahead in finding ways to take advantage of access to this kind of granular data on SKU sales across all sales channels to build more robust models and have more strategic discussions with retail partners.

Companies that do a better of job of engaging retailers in a way that tailors to retailers' positions, leverages their specific data, and makes clear the value that proposals bring to retailers and shoppers may well propel greater price and volume growth.

The current landscape is likely to be among the more challenging in recent memory for consumer goods companies looking to increase net sales. The era of ""easy pricing""--raising prices in a blunt way on the back of inflation spikes--is likely over, and unit consumption growth is a pressing concern. RGM practitioners can help their companies navigate and outperform with a clear-eyed and tailored approach that sets realistic aspirations in the context of the macroeconomic conditions. They can beat the odds with smarter use of AI and gen AI to better align stakeholders and engage retailers. Companies that excel could see as much as a 1.2 to 1.5 times net-price realization above baseline inflation while boosting consumption at category-level rates. That's a worthy goal--and more than enough of a reason to get this right.

"17","New operations management systems for a digital world","Vivek Chhabria , Kar Woon Choy , Rohit Sood , Rob Whiteman","June 21, 2022","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/operations/our-insights/new-operations-management-systems-for-a-digital-world","3","As COVID-19 becomes endemic in much of the world, operations leaders in service businesses see a revolution on the horizon. Rapid digitization, the rise of contactless operations, workforce ""virtualization,"" and innovation in talent sourcing are all creating an urgent imperative for organizations to reconfigure their operations.

When the pandemic started in early 2020, organizations across the globe were forced to virtualize their workforces. The realization that legacy systems no longer worked effectively in this new environment led them to stretch the organizational fabric. Two years later, some organizations have begun to reimagine the tools and assets they need to put in place to regroup and ensure they are set up to meet growth objectives.

Leaders across sectors have shared that they are seeking ways to engrain technology, specifically AI and automation, to better understand their operations.

Nearly half of respondents in the latest McKinsey automation survey said the pandemic accelerated their deployment of new automation technologies. But technologies alone are only part of the story.

In a recent productivity survey of North American executives, ""changing your operating model and organizational structure"" was voted as the most important people and organization lever for achieving deep and lasting change (Exhibit 1). That type of fundamental management change calls for updated management systems to reflect the new environment so that organizations continue to reap rewards from their technology investments. At the same time, these management systems can take advantage of new technologies beyond the basic desktop productivity tools available to workers.

For example, a financial-services organization was eager to deploy effective tools so its employees could spend less time on manual tasks and more time finding better ways to serve its customers. The organization used automation technologies to reduce the time spent on processes and increase time on customer service. By reimagining management systems to both incorporate and address technology improvements, organizations have the chance to usher in the next wave of productivity, continuous innovation, and talent management.

The impact of the pandemic and changing market conditions brought about by technology are increasing the pressure for organizations to modernize operations.

Making this transition requires access to new talent in order to empower an existing workforce to support the transformation and run future operations. In a 2021 McKinsey Global Institute (MGI) productivity survey, over 50 percent of executives said they intended to make investments in translator capabilities, such as product owner skill sets, and over 40 percent said they would make investments in digital and analytics capabilities in the next three years (Exhibit 2).

The experiences of leading companies underscore the importance of a new management system. Companies that better understand and refine the employee experience have an opportunity to turn attrition into attraction. Whether employees are on-site or remote, organizations need processes that support efficient collaboration. This requires new technologies that enable people to share things easily, regardless of where they are.

Communication and document sharing platforms allow employees to collaborate easily, while virtual-conferencing software lets employees work together no matter where they are. Field-service organizations are also piloting virtual-reality solutions that enable maintenance activities to be conducted by experts hundreds of miles away: if an elevator malfunctions, the on-site maintenance team may be able to complete the task with virtual support. Employees no longer need to travel long distances to complete basic tasks.

Despite these advances, however, many organizations are not experiencing the same productivity improvements witnessed in the industrial era. Applying this new way of thinking can help them reach that next level of productivity growth. A 2021 MGI report found that rapid digitization over the past couple of years offers the potential to accelerate annual productivity growth by approximately 1 percent between 2021 and 2024.

While automation software was expensive and out of reach for many organizations a decade ago, it is now affordable and scalable for businesses of all sizes. Digital tools have now reached a level of maturity that is ready for prime time and at-scale deployment. Pre-COVID-19, approximately 18 percent of executives suggested increasing their investment in digitization and automation by over 20 percent. Today, that portion is as high as 34 percent.

Given the dramatic shifts that the operations of most organizations have experienced in the past several years and the tools now available, optimizing manual work is no longer sufficient--the future of continuous improvement is in innovation. Whereas yesterday's managers operated by looking over people with clipboards and manually interpreting data, many tasks can now be automated. Leaving this front-end work to machines offers humans more time and energy to interpret and use the results.

For example, advanced voice analytics software can use natural-language processing to learn the sentiment of thousands of hours of call-center conversations. This can help organizations improve their call-center training or learn which calls to route to an interactive voice response (IVR) system versus a website or chatbot. These tools can also help organizations unlock what their top-performing agents are doing right, whether that's the sentiment of their voice or the kinds of language they are using, and how those best practices can be shared across teams.

These tools shouldn't just be used to serve customers better but also to improve the experience of employees--which would help counter survey findings that show widespread employee willingness to quit. Ideally, a management system should measure morale with more than just annual polls. Substituting digital ""barometers"" that gather weekly (or even daily) data on the factors that matter to a workforce can help leaders create an environment where people can thrive and are excited to stay.

Management systems such as lean and Six Sigma have been used in the public and private sectors for decades to drive efficiencies and improve performance. The original need for management systems originated from a lack of standardization and process among managers and frontline employees, which led to waste, variability, and inflexibility. Standardized processes enabled leaders to put more structure around their thinking, making it easier to get hundreds or thousands of people to work consistently and reliably.

Sharing a common vocabulary made it easier to talk about processes and operations in a structured format--inspiring continuous improvements by helping colleagues to identify and implement new opportunities to work differently. At a large industrial conglomerate, value-stream mapping and performance management metrics enabled a 30 percent contribution margin increase in one year, while a major pharmaceutical company reduced its approval time by 50 percent by using lean thinking.

Over the past couple of decades, new technologies have enabled organizations to improve their management systems incrementally. For many, early success comes from making simple, ""no regret"" decisions that immediately impact and reduce waste in current processes. Organizations can start by using value-stream mapping or the ""five whys"" to identify root causes of waste, variability, and inflexibility. They can often then start leveraging the low-tech solutions they may already have. For instance, a recent McKinsey survey of IT and business decision makers at enterprises in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom, and the United States found that more than 80 percent of respondents use low-code or no-code development platforms requiring few programming skills, enabling them to create a series of performance dialogues to engage the front line.

While technology has changed, the fundamentals of management have not. Management systems for the future will not depend on new fundamentals but rather on how they innovate around the four timeless management disciplines (Exhibit 3).

These new systems will also rely on organizations' ability to improve the tool kit to reflect the digital world and upskill the workforce. Organizations in the public and private sectors have embraced this approach to drive productivity improvements. Consider the following examples:

The organizations that have embraced new technologies did not transform their management systems overnight--they thoughtfully diagnosed their current state to design their future operating model.

We have identified a few essential steps to pave the way for continuous innovation:

To truly foster a culture of continuous innovation, organizations must now leverage technology to power and scale a refined management system. The technology is now more accessible than ever; it's the commitment to change and the willingness to experiment that matter.

"18","What works--and doesn't--in performance management","Brooke Weddle , Bryan Hancock","November 19, 2024","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/what-works-and-doesnt-in-performance-management","3","Much has been written on performance management. Why do so many employees still find it bureaucratic and unfair? On this episode of McKinsey Talks Talent, talent experts Bryan Hancock and Brooke Weddle speak with global editorial director Lucia Rahilly about new research on what drives performance: what motivates employees most, what matters less than you think, and the changes organizations need to make to ensure their feedback, ratings, and review processes are on track.

This transcript has been edited for clarity and length.

Lucia Rahilly: Let's start with the headline. What matters most to employees in driving strong performance?

Brooke Weddle: We continue to see a focus on clarity and simplicity. People want to know what they are being held accountable for, which helps inform another critical factor: a sense of fairness. People perceive a sense of fairness when they have greater clarity. And clarity often comes from simplicity.

A failure mode is being well-intentioned but loading a lot of factors into performance management. Why do organizations do this? Because they want to be holistic in terms of how people are evaluated. But it's often hard to know how those factors are weighted, how they're measured, and how equipped managers are to understand how people measure up. Simplicity tends to win the day.

People view the role of the manager as important not just for evaluations but also for delivering feedback and helping employees act on that feedback in a way that informs a development journey. And that's the good news: the manager continues to be important. The somewhat challenging news is that we don't see managers being able to do this well at scale.

Lucia Rahilly: Let's get into this question of simplicity in goal setting. For many folks nowadays, jobs have taken on more of a portfolio nature. What does effective goal setting look like in this context?

Bryan Hancock: Let's start with what good goal setting does not look like. It's not a sheet of paper that has 25 individual measures on it, with some weighted at 5 percent, some at 10 percent, and some at 2 percent. Then it feels like some mathematical formula on the back end is what's determining how I performed. That's not what good looks like.

Brooke Weddle: Goal setting should be embedded in the day-to-day. For example, some organizations use objectives and key results, or OKRs. OKRs are not one-off; you keep coming back to them to have a performance dialogue. Something's wrong if it's difficult to figure out whether you're progressing against a goal and if you're not homing in on the critical few. Having great ways to measure those is what will win the day.

Lucia Rahilly: Goal setting is one element of what best practices look like. What are other elements of a best-in-class approach to performance management?

Brooke Weddle: During the pandemic, we saw a lot of organizations move to new systems, many of which were ratings-free. They used qualitative ways to describe progress. What we found in the research is that it's not ratings themselves that matter but knowing where you stand.

It's about understanding what it takes to be considered a high-performing employee and how to author your own journey to grow and develop. Sometimes the best way to do that is to have very clear markers and indicators, versus having more ambiguous conversations about what's required for growth.

Bryan Hancock: To me, this was the single-most-striking piece of the research. Whether you've got no ratings, two ratings, three ratings, or five ratings doesn't change employee perception very much. It's how you implement your system that matters.

Is there a fact-based differentiation between why somebody was rated higher than you were and whether you feel it's fair? You might hear people say, ""I don't like it when somebody who is a loafer gets a higher review than me.""

The striking takeaway from this research is to focus much more on how we implement the system, how we have the conversations, and how we upskill our managers. Our recommendation should be to focus on getting the execution right. When you do that, the perception of fairness rises, and the perception that these processes are helpful in driving performance rises.

Brooke Weddle: Only about 20 percent of the respondents to our global survey who had no development conversations felt motivated by their company's performance management. But if you compare that to those who received ongoing feedback in development conversations, the number goes up to 77 percent who felt motivated by it.

Bryan Hancock: The most recent research showed that in large companies, over a third of managers are perceived as not having the skills to have these conversations. So as we think about how to improve performance management, let's think about how to improve the ability of our managers to have upfront, difficult conversations. Improve the development conversations during the year. That's important.

Lucia Rahilly: Development feedback can be taxing to give. What can managers do differently to make feedback discussions simpler and more constructive?

Brooke Weddle: First, I would encourage setting a cultural mindset and behavior around continuous learning, including prioritizing hiring internal talent versus looking for unicorns outside. This is everyone's job. This is not HR's job.

Managers can also identify ways to make giving feedback not just something they do when they have spare time, but rather part of daily work--and even come up with a ritual for a team. How can you start or end every week with a check-in that has some form of feedback?

I also think managers, when supported by their organizations, can experiment. Using technology could help. Many organizations are looking at performance management as a use case for generative AI. How can managers use generative AI to synthesize live conversations, interview notes, to allow them to spend more time supporting colleagues?

Bryan Hancock, Brooke Weddle, and other talent experts help you navigate a fast-changing landscape and prepare for the future of work by making talent a competitive advantage.

Bryan Hancock: About 43 percent of managers report being burned out. Performance management can become something managers do at the tail end of their day, under enormous pressure for time. As we know from our earlier podcast guest, research psychologist Jamil Zaki, if you don't have time, you're less sympathetic.

What that means is managers don't have time for thoughtful conversations. It's last on their list. They need to be able to approach these conversations in a way that is both empowering and challenging.

If you're pressed for time, it's much easier to say, ""You did these three things wrong; let me do them for you right now,"" than to step back and say, ""Hey, how did you think about this? How did you get here? Let's talk through that."" That's a very different, higher-level conversation that requires more skill and time.

Lucia Rahilly: How has hybrid work affected managers' clarity about what their employees are doing?

Bryan Hancock: Periodic feedback, whether at the end of a week or a month, should truly be about coaching the individual. What we've seen is whether in a hybrid environment, a fully remote environment, or a fully in-person environment, unless managers are deliberate about carving out time, that kind of stepped-back, developmental feedback isn't happening. I don't think hybrid is necessarily causing a downfall in those types of conversations. There's a shortage of them regardless of whether our work is in-person or remote.

Brooke Weddle: Thoughtfulness around where and how work gets done relative to a goal is a core part of a manager's job. That has become more complicated, given that we are working in different formats. As we think about upskilling and supporting managers, having nuanced conversations around goals and accomplishing work is new and needs to be addressed.

Lucia Rahilly: In your survey, more than half of respondents said their managers do not fall into the skilled practitioner category when it comes to delivering reviews. Is there anything HR should do differently to facilitate better coaching for managers?

Bryan Hancock: Practice with challenging conversations helps. Prepandemic, we were working with a large institution with well over 100,000 employees. Going into review season, we set up coaching sessions where, alongside HR and the training folks, a manager could say, ""Here's the type of feedback I'm thinking of giving; help me give this in the right way.""

One thing I'm excited about is managers being able to use gen AI to try out feedback and then get feedback on the feedback. For example, a bot might say, ""Hey, that wasn't direct enough. That was unclear. You referenced some things that could be perceived as biased."" This builds skills, but it also builds confidence in the conversation. It's the equivalent of practicing a speech in front of a mirror before delivering it to an audience. With gen AI, instead of a mirror, you're giving the feedback to a bot. And the bot plays back, saying, ""Here are the parts that are helpful and not helpful.""

This is just one example of how HR can provide tools in the right context. But if the manager still doesn't have time to give feedback, they won't have time to practice on a bot. So it does require the broader environment to change as well.

Brooke Weddle: I think what HR can do, apart from what Bryan is saying, is stop the paperwork. I've worked with at least three organizations in the past eight to 12 months that have made bold moves to simplify their processes.

There's value in taking a hard look at where you're deriving value. For example, is this additional lever really going to change the feedback, and is this step in the process really required? I've seen organizations create a lot of time by simplifying the core elements of their process.

Bryan Hancock: The challenge with simplifying the process is when it's time to move on because someone is not a good performer, you need a fact-based record of that nonperformance.

But what we're advocating for is this: instead of designing a performance management process for the 5 percent who may need to leave the organization, let's design a performance management process for the 95 percent who are going to stay and whom we want to make high performers.

Lucia Rahilly: Have we gotten better at helping managers remove people from roles where they're a poor fit or not performing?

Bryan Hancock: The short answer is we've seen some change. It's important to have the right interventions and development conversations with those folks early. If somebody feels like they understand what they're doing, they're being coached on it, but they're still not up to the bar, that makes it much easier for them to come to their own realization that it may be time to move on. But managers need to lean in when they see somebody struggling, not lean out.

Lucia Rahilly: We haven't yet talked about money. For some companies in this kind of low- or slow-growth environment, financial rewards may be less liberal than in some years past. And at least in places like the US, inflation and the cost of living are real issues for folks. How much does money matter?

Brooke Weddle: In our survey, more than half of respondents felt motivated when financial rewards were combined with nonfinancial rewards. What do we mean by nonfinancial rewards? Opportunities to grow and develop and, just as powerful, things like praise from your manager, your leader, a senior leader in the company.

This goes back to years of social science research that what people crave is, yes, some form of compensation they deem fair, but above that, a sense of being valued as a human, of meaning in their work, and of connection between what they're doing and what the company is trying to do. And that their manager sees that and brings that to life.

Bryan Hancock: There is a distinction here for people who are revenue generators: for example, folks in sales, who have a real role in whether they hit that next target or not, whether they knock on the next door. In those worlds, compensation does play a meaningful role.

But if you take a step back broadly, across roles, across organizations, what Brooke is saying is absolutely true: financial rewards matter, but they matter in the broader context. People are motivated by how they feel, and compensation contributes to how they feel. It can contribute to employees feeling rewarded when it comes with nonfinancial rewards and also to feeling not rewarded when they look around and feel their comp isn't fair.

Lucia Rahilly: Speaking of fairness, we've just published our Women in the Workplace research. And obviously there continues to be a gap in women's pay versus men's pay for similar positions. Anything folks should be thinking about to reduce bias in assessing impact and performance?

Brooke Weddle: So many things is probably the short answer. If you look at the Women in the Workplace 2024 report, we still have a broken rung. Even if you get women in the door early on, they are more likely to leave at a certain point--call it manager or senior manager level. Understanding that and trying different ways to help women make that transition and avoid the broken rung is really important.

A lot of leading organizations I'm working with are also taking a hard look at the roles women hold and are encouraged to pursue over time. Do these roles eventually lead to leadership roles? Or are women progressing on paths that are not central to delivering company performance?

Bryan Hancock: I really like how Brooke framed that. To me, there are two components. First, how do we fix bias in the review room? That includes unconscious-bias training, having observers for bias in the room, doing calibration meetings to see if for similar roles we're getting different outcomes--really pressure testing those.

The second part of what Brooke's talking about is how to make sure women are on a career track that puts them in the heart of their company's operation, the heart of what makes them financially successful. This comes down to the conversations women are having with their managers. How do managers guide them to roles that are the best fit while also keeping in mind roles that are central to the company's performance and therefore lead to the most senior roles across the organization?

Lucia Rahilly: Bringing us back to where we started, anything that surprised you about the research?

Brooke Weddle: What surprised me most was something Bryan said earlier about ratings. What it comes down to is not the rating system itself, but rather being clear about what you want employees to do. Tying that to simple goals and then having continuous conversations is a good road map for strengthening performance management. That plus a few bold moves that make a true difference in driving performance and the employee engagement that comes with that.

Bryan Hancock: Maybe not surprising but disheartening: we've done research on performance management in 2016, 2018, and 2024. And still, the majority of folks find it too bureaucratic and unfair. As Brooke highlights, it's not about the boxes but about how we conduct the process. What I'm hopeful for is that this research starts to spark a broader conversation on how to improve the way we're doing this--not the boxes but how we collaboratively set goals, how we have conversations on an ongoing basis.

Maybe one of the unlocks here is generative AI, in that generative AI helps give managers time back. I'm hopeful that awareness plus some of these new tools can help change, finally, some of the ""how"" of the process. But we'll have to see.

Institutions on either side of the Atlantic collectively hold more than $6 trillion in sovereign and related securities alone, along with plenty more in lower-rated securities.1
The vast volumes of these bonds that are not traded are under rising regulatory scrutiny, particularly in the European Union, where the European Banking Authority (EBA) has warned of potential material losses from credit spread risk in the banking book (CSRBB) and has published guidelines to support oversight.2
In this context, the challenge for treasury teams is how best to interpret EBA guidance while ensuring they retain optimal levels of liquidity to meet their operational needs.

In Europe, banks are required under EBA guidelines published in 2023 to assess and monitor CSRBB in their risk management and capital assessment processes.3
The biggest risks are presumed to be in widely held asset classes such as sovereign and financial institution debt, particularly in longer tenors. Although US banks are not directly bound by European regulation, the European Union's approach affects US banks operating in Europe and may more widely affect global Basel Committee standards. CSRBB risk may also factor into US regulatory scrutiny of liquidity and capital buffers.

According to an EBA quantitative impact study, more than 90 percent of European bank CSRBB exposure arises from liquidity reserves, with the asset composition of the liquidity buffer having a significant impact on capital requirements.4
Under the Bank for International Settlements definition, securities that are eligible as high-quality liquid assets (HQLA) account for about 50 percent of European bank liquidity reserves on average, and a significant 10 percent of balance sheets, albeit with significant national variations, the EBA says.5

Following publication of the EBA guidance, European banks have started to allocate significant amounts of Pillar 2 capital to CSRBB. But approaches and allocations vary across the market, including how banks interpret the scope of included instruments and the definition of credit spreads. Many banks, meanwhile, have moved to impose concentration limits on their portfolios, which has a constraining impact on their capital allocations.

In this article, we discuss four aspects of the EBA's CSRBB guidelines that continue to provoke industry discussions. We highlight how some leading banks are tackling these dimensions within the ambit of their risk management frameworks and discuss a potential approach that could amount to a blueprint for CSRBB risk management throughout the economic cycle.

In its guidelines, the European Banking Authority encourages banks to measure the impact of changing credit spreads on both their economic value of equity (EVE) and their net interest income (NII). This much is clear, but across the market, there is continuing uncertainty over four key guidance areas:

Each of these elements can affect how banks manage liquidity reserves, and thus requires careful evaluation based on an understanding of the full costs and benefits of different options. Here, we show how some banks are addressing the challenge.

Where should banks draw the line on what falls within the scope of CSRBB and what does not? The EBA says that banks are free to decide but must justify items not included and should not preemptively exclude any instrument in the banking book, regardless of its accounting treatment. Indeed, banks should consider assets, liabilities, derivatives, and other off-balance-sheet items such as loans.6
Where banks do exclude items, they must be able to show the absence of sensitivity to credit spread risk. Broadly speaking, we see seven main categories of balance sheet items that should be considered for inclusion (Exhibit 1).

In our contacts with banking leaders, the majority approach has been to include all securities definitively in the banking book and then consider whether any other securities may also qualify. To aid in decision-making, the European Banking Federation has published a useful decision tree, reflecting the criterion laid out in the guidelines based on whether there are reliable and observable market prices for any particular security.

One area where there is considerable uncertainty is liabilities, particularly fixed-income securities. Although there is little argument that banks' own bonds are affected by changes in market credit spreads, some banks, and also maybe regulators, are not comfortable with the implications--specifically, that they could see a rise in their economic value of equity (an offsetting factor in liquidity reserve terms) from a deterioration in peer credit spreads. One idea to address this challenge would be to consider different approaches for calculating EVE and NII sensitivity measurements and risk appetites.

Recognizing that the economic and geopolitical landscape is inherently, and increasingly, uncertain and prone to bouts of volatility, regulatory guidance on CSRBB risk management aims to capture two key ways in which CSRBB can manifest7
:

The combination of market spread and liquidity spread amounts to a distinct new lens on risk that notably does not consider credit ratings or creditworthiness, does not overlap with credit valuation adjustment, but does encompass currency dimensions.

Given these specifications, the EBA is clear that CSRBB would be best managed under a dedicated framework defined by robust risk policies and processes, for example in relation to measurement, model assumptions, and lines of responsibility. In addition, the framework should incorporate systems and standards for monitoring, valuing, and assessing exposures, as well as a comprehensive reporting and review process, effective internal controls and management information systems, and finally a defined risk appetite to aid decision-making.

Banks can take one of several different approaches to CSRBB calculation, including stress testing (for example, increase to a certain percentile of observed spreads), standardized shocks (for example, +/-100 basis points, in the spirit of interest rate risk in the banking book [IRRBB]), or measures of sensitivity (CS01), value at risk, or expected shortfall. Overall, we see four approaches that are attracting interest:

While many banks are considering multiple options, we see most going in one of two directions:

When it comes to resource allocation and limit setting, institutions currently adopt a variety of approaches, with, for example, some banks choosing to set limits by issuer and others focusing on spread class or credit rating. Our analysis shows that issuer rating and historical credit spread volatility are not necessarily strongly correlated (Exhibit 2). However, factors such as maturity and liquidity are relevant to decision-making.

A key question for banks is how much Pillar 2 capital they should hold against the risk. Here, a pertinent question will be how to calculate capital in the context of risks such as credit valuation adjustment (CVA), IRRBB, jump-to-default risk, and market risk. Certainly, initial calibration of CSRBB economic capital presents banks with a unique opportunity to align with supervisors on an approach that avoids excessive risks.

Following the definition of the most important elements of a CSRBB risk appetite framework, the task will fall to the treasury team to find an optimal allocation for the liquidity reserve, bearing in mind the efficient frontier based on asset volatility (Exhibit 3).

In making liquidity reserve decisions, there will be an inevitable trade-off between risk and return, but also, and less intuitively, between different types of risk (Exhibit 4). For example, credit spread risk (measured by CS01) and credit default risk (as represented by risk weights in the standardized approach for calculation of prudential capital according to Basel III rules) can be balanced to achieve a specific yield.

This trade-off is also visible with reference to the efficient frontier in classic portfolio theory, represented by the portfolio with the lowest CS01 for a given spread level.

In both the European Union and globally, the new CSRBB supervisory expectations are a clear challenge for bank treasury and risk functions, at a time when teams are already faced with wider credit spreads and stronger differentiation among borrowers. Despite these parallel and often significant challenges--indeed, because of them--banks should see the benefits and opportunities in proactively getting a grip on the EBA guidelines and the decisions that will shape oversight in the future. The good news is that effective management of the liquidity buffer is a route to multiple CSRBB benefits, including safer operations and preparedness for shifts in both market and regulatory landscapes."

This article focuses on the fourth: act. To ensure that plans developed in the previous stage (architect) stay on track and evolve when necessary, leaders must give employees a sense of ownership in the process, as well as the energy needed to change. This article shows how.

The previous stages of our five-stage program will give employees a significant degree of ownership. But don't assume it will continue throughout the act stage. To see that it does, establish strong governance, scale up initiatives appropriately, and monitor and adjust them as needed.

Research shows that change programs with governance structures clearly identifying roles and responsibilities are 6.4 times more likely to succeed. The vast majority of successful programs include four such elements: an executive steering committee (ESC), a change-management office (CMO), executive sponsors (ESs), and initiative owners (IOs) and their teams.

An executive steering committee typically includes the most senior leader and a senior executive team. It owns the change program's overall direction; makes critical ongoing decisions, such as approving changes in execution plans, reallocating resources, resolving issues, and reshaping initiatives; and holds people accountable for results. When the ESC communicates the progress of change programs frequently during the act stage, they are a whopping eight times more likely to succeed.

The change-management office coordinates the overall program, tracking its progress, resolving issues, and facilitating transparent, effective interactions between the ESC and the initiatives. It seldom leads them but sometimes helps share best practices and acts as a thought partner for initiative teams. Typically, a full-time senior leader responsible for the overall change program runs the CMO. Its size depends on the transformation's nature, but it typically includes resources for monitoring and reviewing activities, metrics, budgets, and impact, as well as for communications and change management.

Executive sponsors provide guidance, judgment, and leadership for initiative teams by reviewing their progress, helping periodically to solve problems, suggesting and validating changes to execution plans, and focusing on the business impact. They may be either members of the ESC or senior leaders, one level down, who directly own particular initiatives. The ES strives to optimize particular initiatives; the ESC, the full portfolio.

Initiatives are executed by initiative owners and their teams, who typically work for line organizations but may also come from staff functions. IOs generally help formulate the initiative charter; identify resources, operating expenses, and capital requirements; determine the scale-up approach; and develop timelines and milestones. Their responsibilities include both problem solving and people solving.

The CMO provides support and oversight. But accountability for the impact of initiatives should be placed, so far as possible, with line management and built into relevant budgets--no aspect of a change program is complete until they fully reflect it. Programs with clear roles and responsibilities are six times more likely to succeed than programs that don't; those with effective CMOs, twice as likely.

To understand this governance model, consider the case of a retailer restructuring its global operations after quarterly losses. When an organizational-health survey identified many health issues, the CEO created an ESC comprising senior leaders from the retailer and its parent company. The retailer then created a CMO led by the respected senior manager of its most profitable business line. He enlisted one of his top performers and two respected middle managers from other departments and hired an external change expert and a retail-turnaround specialist. Each of the 25 health initiatives identified in the architect stage had an IO and ES who helped ensure that teams remained committed to targets and had the necessary resources. The teams also included part-time ""project amplifiers,"" who publicized initiatives to the organization and communicated its concerns back to the teams.

This clear ownership model helped the retailer to reorganize its 75,000-strong workforce and to cut costs by 12 percent within six months. The whole company's health improved significantly. The program's light yet robust structure was easily dismantled, and the business then took responsibility for the ongoing effort.

Companies implement the vast majority of initiatives by testing ideas, learning from failures, and scaling up successes quickly--an approach that limits damage, provides valuable lessons, and builds an appetite for change. But impatient organizations often implement pilots too quickly.

Consider the experience of the Netherlands-based insurance group Achmea. Spurred by the government's radical healthcare reforms, the company launched a change program in one of its divisions. The initiatives included a plan to raise the call center's efficiency by 25 percent and to improve the customer experience. Achmea's initial pilot was a huge success, but the company soon found that the approach of the manager who led the effort was hard to replicate because he had relied on personal influence, not new systems. As this example shows, the pilot phase should include two tests: proof of concept (to establish that an idea creates value) and proof of feasibility (to ensure replicability). Often, this second test also trains leaders for later waves of implementation. Once Achmea adopted the double-pilot approach, the change program proceeded successfully.

Companies can choose among three broad ""flavors"" for scaling initiatives: linear, geometric, and ""big bang"" (Exhibit 1). In the first, the proof-of-feasibility pilot is replicated across the organization, but no area starts until the previous one finishes. This works best if a company rolls out an initiative in only a few areas and isn't in crisis, the stakes are high, deep dives by experts are needed, resistance to change is strong, and the tool kit and solutions require extensive customization.

In geometric scale-ups, implementation occurs in progressively bigger waves. This makes sense if multiple areas share a few common features, many areas must be transformed, a linear approach would take too long, capable implementers are readily available (or can be trained ahead of demand), and the organization can absorb the changes. In big-bang scale-ups, implementation occurs across all relevant areas at once. That takes many resources, but for a relatively short time, and makes sense if multiple areas share many features, the transformation is urgently needed, little resistance is expected, and the company can deploy a standard tool kit.

A multinational energy company, for example, used the linear approach to roll out unified HR software that replaced freestanding national systems. Senior management understood that if the company switched in one go, or even region by region, technical issues might overload the project. The new software represented a major shift, so the company also wanted to ensure that all country organizations embraced it and that concerns at any one location could be addressed before the rollout continued.

But this company chose a geometric approach to implement its new global procurement strategy. An analysis of vendor relationships uncovered similarities among markets in buying patterns and levels of procurement sophistication and vendor choice. Grouping similar markets into clusters enabled the company to increase its leverage with vendors. It then used the geometric approach to roll out the project in increasingly large groups of regions and countries. Procurement teams got up to speed quickly, approaches were progressively refined, and cost savings escalated rapidly.

Another initiative revamped public-relations processes. The company had recently experienced a crisis it hadn't handled well, because of a decentralized approach to managing its public image. One initiative therefore centralized stakeholder management and PR, installed new policies and guidelines, and aimed to make the general public and key stakeholders aware of the company's efforts to improve transparency and accountability. A big-bang effort fully implemented the program in two months.

To work effectively and scale up multiple initiatives during the act stage, the CMO must provide both an initiative- and program-level view of progress and impact through relevant metrics and milestones. When it does, change programs are 7.3 times more likely to succeed. This mandate requires good data. As N. R. Narayana Murthy, former chairman of Infosys, put it, ""In God we trust; everybody else brings data to the table.""

To have a robust view of how much progress you're making, regularly measure your change program on at least four dimensions:

The particular metrics to monitor in each dimension will be specific to individual programs, but less is more: metrics often cascade into unwieldy, complex permutations. A McKinsey analysis shows that organizations use only 29 percent of the metrics they claim to follow in change efforts.

Next, decide how often to measure and review the metrics. In large-scale change programs, initiatives should be reviewed weekly by their teams; health and performance, monthly or quarterly by sponsors and steering committees; and enterprise value, once or twice a year by everyone in the program. Reviews enforce accountability, identify issues and best practices, determine remedies, spotlight successes, and instill a culture of continuous learning and improvement.

Don't confine the monitoring and review to the past. As Telefónica de España's former managing director and COO Julio Linares warns, ""The market is going to change constantly, and because of that you need to make a constant effort to adapt to the market. Of course, some parts of the program will end, but new ones will come up."" Change programs led by CMOs that adjust them as needed are 4.6 times more likely to succeed.2

No matter how well you plan initiatives during the architect stage, some will probably flounder when you get to act: 28 percent of well-planned initiatives don't deliver the results forecast, so the CMO should expect to redirect or stop some initiatives, launch new ones, and reallocate resources quickly. Our data show that, on average, the execution end dates of 31 percent of initiatives change once, 28 percent twice, and 19 percent three times. The CMO's role is to ensure that this happens for the right reasons, with rigorous problem solving and no last-minute delays or surprises--a reason to monitor metrics weekly.

During change programs, employees must conduct everyday business while changing the way it's done. That additional work requires additional energy, so change leaders must ensure that programs generate more of it during the act stage than they consume. Change leaders can create energy by mobilizing influencers, making change programs personal for a critical mass of leaders, and engaging the workforce with two-way communications.

Senior leaders aren't the only people who guide employees; influencers deep in organizations can disproportionately affect their colleagues' energy levels if a change program excites them. Regardless of their official title or status, they draw power from the many personal contacts who respect and emulate them. Malcolm Gladwell's best seller The Tipping Point3
describes three types: ""mavens"" accumulate knowledge and share advice, ""connectors"" know many people, and ""salespeople"" can naturally persuade others. Our research indicates that engaging influencers in change programs makes them 3.8 times more likely to succeed.

Consider the example of a change program for maternal healthcare in Africa. No traditional form of intervention (such as pamphlets) worked. Eventually, the leaders realized that hairdressers were extremely influential--hair salons were among the few places where young women could talk about the health of mothers. When the campaign refocused on hairdressers, the message got through.

You can find these sometimes-hidden influencers through social-network analysis (Exhibit 2). One application--""snowball sampling""--uses techniques social scientists developed to study hidden populations: two- to three-question surveys ask employees to nominate (anonymously) three to five people whose advice they respect. These five are also surveyed, and the survey ends when names are repeated--often, after only three to four rounds. Leaders frequently find the results surprising because influence patterns rarely reflect organizational charts.

Companies can mobilize influence leaders effectively in many ways-for example, enrolling them in pilots. At the very least, create a two-way pipeline giving influencers early access to information, so that you gather important feedback on the program's implementation. By using this group to refine new ideas, you can also increase the effectiveness and acceptance of the ideas you implement.

Mindsets created by an old stimulus last far longer than the stimulus itself, so if you rely solely on changes in the work environment (a new stimulus) to shift mindsets, you'll wait a long time. What's more, changes to the work environment won't affect everyone similarly. Finally, and perhaps most vexingly, to change the work environment, programs must rely partly on leaders to role model the new behavior, even in the absence of any significant external stimulus. Companies must therefore recognize that the biggest barrier to personal change is overcoming the propensity to see other people as the problem.

At one company, for example, we asked leaders to estimate how much time they spent tiptoeing around other people's egos. Most said 20 to 30 percent. Then we asked these leaders how much time an employee might spend tiptoeing around their egos. Most were silent. Our research shows that 86 percent of leaders claim to role model behavioral changes, but only 53 percent of the people who report to them agree.

Our journey to find ways of kick-starting change among leaders has led to the development of what we call personal-insight workshops (PIWs), which mostly take place offsite, in groups of 20 to 30, over a couple of days. During PIWs, facilitators who understand the principles of adult learning and human-potential techniques take participants through the ""U-process,"" which involves three phases.

The first, sensing, typically takes 30 percent of the workshop's time. Participants explore the company's change story in the context of their own. During the second phase, presencing, which typically accounts for some 40 percent of the workshop's time, the session turns further inward.

Participants examine their beliefs about what's possible in the workplace, reflecting on questions such as ""when do I feel in the 'flow' and what takes me out of it, into fight-, flight-, or freeze-type responses?"" ""What has conditioned me to respond in this way?"" ""Can I respond in a different way if I frame situations differently?"" ""What are the benefits and risks if I do?"" ""How would these different ways of thinking and acting create a more powerful personal legacy?"" ""How does all this link to the bigger organizational change discussed in the sensing phase?"" These techniques help participants to understand their attitudes toward (and more fully embrace) the change program's organizational mindset and behavior shifts and therefore increase their impact as role models.

Now the U-process enters its third phase: realizing, which typically accounts for 30 percent of the workshop's time. Here participants decide how they will apply the insights from the previous phase in their day-to-day work, how to use their personal networks to mobilize support, and what the group will do collectively.

Companies will see material shifts in the leadership's role-modeling impact once a critical mass of 25 to 30 percent of their people leaders attend such programs. At this point, many leaders are replacing the ""if only they would change"" mentality with the ethos of ""if it's to be, it's up to me,"" so that it becomes contagious and spreads to the whole population.4
Not every successful change program uses PIW techniques, but in our experience every change program that did succeeded. In particular, we've seen PIWs thaw the change-resistant ""frozen middle"" of managers more quickly and effectively than any other approach.

The final element of the act stage--high-impact two-way communications that energize the organization--makes change programs four times more likely to succeed. Consider an experiment involving two groups of people: ""tappers"" and ""listeners.""5
In a preparatory session, the tappers were told they would drum out the rhythm of famous tunes, such as ""Happy Birthday to You,"" with their fingers. The listeners would have to guess what it was. Then the experimenters asked the tappers to predict what proportion of the songs the listeners would identify correctly. They guessed half. The actual result was 2.5 percent. As the tappers tapped, they became visibly frustrated with the bewildered listeners. The lesson: if you know something, you find it hard to imagine not knowing it--""the curse of knowledge.""

We constantly see it at work in change programs. Leaders who have been deeply involved in creating the change story assume that others will absorb it quickly. But when anyone first hears the story, what leaders consider carefully crafted messages come across as disconnected ideas. To break the curse, use a combination of four approaches.

First, leaders who retell a story should understand what it's like to hear it for the first time by testing it on others. Second, make the message stick by relentlessly repeating simple, memorable language; Walmart's ""ten-foot rule,"" for example, supports customer service by reminding frontline employees that whenever they are within ten feet of a customer, they should look him or her in the eye, smile, and ask how they can help. As Willie Walsh, who has been chief executive of several airline companies, puts it, ""The simpler the message, the easier it is to deliver. The simpler the message, the more likely it is to be consistent. The simpler the message, the easier it is to control and manage the communication.""6

A third way is to move from ""telling"" to ""asking,"" which uses even chance encounters effectively. Emerson Electric's CEO David Farr asks virtually all employees he meets four questions: ""How do you make a difference?,"" ""What improvement ideas are you working on?,"" ""When did you last get coaching from your boss?,"" and ""Who is the enemy?""7
This way of engaging employees has far more impact than simply exhorting them about the company's health themes: alignment, continuous improvement, coaching, and collaboration.

The fourth way of overcoming the curse is to ensure that many channels--speech, print, online, symbols, rituals--reinforce your messages. In fact, the best two-way communications programs not only tell the same story through multiple channels but also tell different aspects of it through different channels. Companies should use channels creatively--particularly social media. We've seen successful two-way communications strategies involving blogs, tweets, videos, podcasts, ""jams,""8
and online Wiki-like resource centers tailored to employee segments. These become even more powerful when interwoven with in-person formats, such as large group offsites and unannounced visits.

Equally important, create bottom-up channels. When Lisa Hook was Neustar's CEO, she sponsored a video competition to communicate the company's performance-and-health strategy. Employees submitted videos and voted for them online; the executive committee chose the winner and the CEO presented an award. Likewise, during a change program in the early 2000s, employees of the Australian telecommunications company Telstra created a ""rogue"" comic strip to challenge cynicism about a change program. The corporate center can seed such bottom-up efforts, but they must spread autonomously. Infrastructure and funding may be needed, and some companies give influence leaders a small budget and a mandate to ""start a fire"" (create energy for change).

Some powerful channels for changing mindsets and generating energy are often underutilized--for instance, new rituals. When a mining company made safety a theme of its change program, it started meetings with announcements about emergency exits and safety hazards. Another underutilized channel is the outside world. As Banca Intesa's former CEO Corrado Passera reflects, internal results matter little ""if everyone keeps reading in the newspapers that the business is still a poor performer, is not contributing to society, or is letting down the country as a whole."" Change leaders should look for ways of leveraging customers, users, and other stakeholders to generate energy for change.

Organizations can maximize a multichannel strategy's power by starting with an employee segment and mapping its change-experience journey. Employees may, for example, learn about the change program in an offsite interactive story-cascade session, read about it on the company's home page, and see posters about it on walls at work. At home, they may learn about it in the press. Next, they could take part in a skill-building ""field and forum"" journey to improve as change leaders. Eventually, they will notice how changing structures, processes, systems, and incentives are realizing the change story's vision and plan. Employees experience a coherent, reinforcing journey taking them from their previous mindsets and behavior toward those needed to make change programs succeed.

In each of our five stages of performance and health, we emphasize a masterstroke: counterintuitive lessons from the field of predictable irrationality. Discounting them causes frustration and delay; leveraging them can greatly accelerate a change program's impact. In this, the act stage, the masterstroke involves incentives.

Conventional wisdom is clear: if compensation isn't linked to the objectives of a change program, employees believe that it isn't important. Unfortunately, however, the upside to linking change objectives to financial compensation is generally limited, practically and psychologically. In practice, compensation can rise only within limits and reflects many metrics: overall company performance, the P&L of individual areas, and so forth. No one metric affects overall results significantly. Changing a company's approach to compensation is also hard--typically requiring board approval--and unintended consequences may ensue.

From a psychological standpoint, the benefit of increased income on happiness greatly decreases beyond $75,000 a year. Besides, financial incentives become less effective the more organizations use them.9
Fortunately, leaders needn't rely heavily on compensation to drive change; they can stimulate motivation by using what the field of predictable irrationality calls a social--not a market--exchange. Say you go to someone's house for dinner and afterward ask your host how much money you owe her. The offer of money changes a social interaction into a cringeworthy market transaction. Yet if you had brought your host a bottle of good wine, she would have accepted it gladly. A gift is a symbol of long-term, reciprocal social norms rather than short-term, transactional market norms.10

This social approach to shaping behavior is cheaper and often more effective. The American Association of Retired Persons (AARP), for example, once asked lawyers to give discounted prices to retirees. The lawyers declined. Then the AARP, understanding the lesson we have described, went to other lawyers and asked them to work free of charge. Most agreed.11
Compensation invoked market norms; pro-bono work, social ones.

The best change leaders use small, unexpected nonfinancial rewards and recognition to great effect. When John McFarlane was CEO of ANZ bank, he gave every employee a bottle of champagne for Christmas, and that had far more impact than a bonus equaling the champagne's cost. As CEO of PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi sent thoughtful, hand-written letters praising her top team not only to its members but also to their spouses, creating enormous additional motivation for change. You can take people to lunch, leave laudatory Post-it Notes for them, or give them public recognition among their peers. As Walmart founder Sam Walton said, ""Nothing else can quite substitute for a few well-chosen, well-timed, sincere words of praise. They're absolutely free--and worth a fortune.""12

The first three stages of the change journey (aspire, assess, and architect) typically take months; the act stage, years. Don't count on the initial excitement to last; instead, generate energy and create ownership methodically to keep your change program on the right path throughout its twists and turns. We often liken the act stage to sports. When a team takes the field, it has a game plan, but once the whistle blows, points rarely come from well-rehearsed plays. The ability to improvise within the game plan usually makes the difference between winning and losing, in sports and business alike.

"22","Build a change platform, not a change program","Gary Hamel , Michele Zanini","October 1, 2014","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/build-a-change-platform-not-a-change-program","5","Transformational-change initiatives have a dismal track record. In 1996, Harvard Business School professor John Kotter claimed that nearly 70 percent of large-scale change programs didn't meet their goals,1
and virtually every survey since has shown similar results. Why is change so confounding? We don't think the issue lies with an understanding of its building blocks--Kotter's classic eight-step change-management model is still a helpful guide. The problem lies in beliefs about who is responsible for launching change and how change is implemented.

The reality is that today's organizations were simply never designed to change proactively and deeply--they were built for discipline and efficiency, enforced through hierarchy and routinization. As a result, there's a mismatch between the pace of change in the external environment and the fastest possible pace of change at most organizations. If it were otherwise, we wouldn't see so many incumbents struggling to intercept the future.

In most organizations, change is regarded as an episodic interruption of the status quo, something initiated and managed from the top. The power to initiate strategic change is concentrated there, and every change program must be endorsed, scripted, and piloted before launch. Transformational change,2
when it does happen, is typically belated and convulsive--and often commences only after a ""regime change."" What's needed is a real-time, socially constructed approach to change, so that the leader's job isn't to design a change program but to build a change platform--one that allows anyone to initiate change, recruit confederates, suggest solutions, and launch experiments.

Three intertwined assumptions limit the efficacy of the traditional model of change:

Change starts at the top. This mind-set implies that executives have the sole right to initiate deep change and are best placed to judge when it is necessary. Truth is, executives are often the last to know. They are insulated from reality by layers of managers who are often reluctant to sound an alarm. By the time an issue is big enough and unavoidable enough to attract the scarce attention of the CEO, the organization is already playing defense. That's why most change programs are, in fact, catch-up programs. Moreover, risk-averse executives are seldom willing to launch a company-wide change program that ventures beyond the safe precincts of best practice. The result: change programs that are too little, too late.

Change is rolled out. When change is imposed from above, with both ends and means prescribed, it's rarely embraced. Traditional change programs fail to harness the discretionary creativity and energy of employees and often generate cynicism and resistance. Senior executives talk about the need to get buy-in, but genuine buy-in is the product of involvement, not slick packaging and communication. To be embraced, a change effort must be socially constructed in a process that gives everyone the right to set priorities, diagnose barriers, and generate options. Despite assertions to the contrary, people aren't against change--they are against royal edicts. The alternative: change that's rolled up, not rolled out.

Change is engineered. The phrase ""change management"" implies that deep change can be managed, like a large-scale construction project or an IT overhaul. But if change is truly transformational--if it breaks new ground--it can't be predetermined. Think for a moment about how our lives have been changed by the social web--Facebook, Pinterest, Snapchat, Twitter, and all the rest. No single individual or entity invented the social web. It emerged, in all its weird and wonderful variety, because the Internet is a powerful platform for making connections and because thousands of entrepreneurs were free to develop new business models to harness that power. When change programs are engineered, the solution space is limited by what people at the top can imagine. A change platform, by contrast, gives everyone the right to suggest strategic alternatives. The advantage: options that are diverse, radical, and nuanced.

Management literature is rich with case studies of bottom-up, spontaneous change and of product and business innovation sparked by the efforts of frontline activists.3
Inspiring as such stories are, however, few of these efforts effect systemic change across an entire organization. Internal activism and small wins don't easily scale. Neither do they address the core management systems, processes, and cultural norms that dictate how large organizations run.

The challenge is to tackle deep change for tough systemic issues in a way that avoids the pitfalls of traditional change programs. Put another way: how do you create platforms for sustained company-wide conversations that can amplify weak signals and support the complex problem solving needed to address core management challenges?

We believe that three shifts in approach are necessary:

From top-down to activist-out. Transformational change conventionally starts at the top because companies haven't enabled it to start anywhere else. To make deep change proactive and pervasive, the responsibility for initiating change needs to be syndicated across the organization. For instance, it was a small group of trainee clinicians, young leaders, and improvement facilitators in Britain's National Health Service who developed and ran NHS Change Day 2013--the biggest improvement effort in the history of the NHS. Internal activists, multiplying their impact through social media, spawned a grassroots movement of 189,000 people who pledged to take concrete action to improve healthcare outcomes. When Change Day was repeated this year, the number of pledges exceeded 800,000. Change Day has enabled everyone to be a change leader and improved the care of patients.

From sold to invited. Transformational change cannot be sustained without genuine commitment on the part of those who will be most affected. This commitment is best achieved by bidding out the change program's ""how"" to everyone in the organization. Consider the approach that fast-growing medical-device company Nuvasive took to reengineer its supply chain. Instead of appointing a task force of senior leaders, the CEO invited the entire company to ""hack"" the customer-fulfillment process. Associates from around the organization, supported by a small coordination team and volunteer coaches, eagerly contributed to a process that generated a common view of the problem (from the front line up), a set of shared aspirations for world-class performance, and a portfolio of new initiatives to achieve it.

From managed to organic. Psychologist Kurt Lewin's seminal ""unfreeze-change-freeze"" model still guides how most leaders think about change. But in a world that's relentlessly evolving, anything that is frozen soon becomes irrelevant. What we need instead is constant experimentation--with new operating models, business models, and management models. Not freeze and refreeze, but ""permanent slush."" This approach means placing less emphasis on building a powerful project-management office and more on building self-organizing communities that identify, experiment, and eventually scale new initiatives. At Cemex, the global cement and building-materials company with revenue of $15 billion in 2013, self-defined communities generate and implement thousands of change initiatives each year. For example, the ReadyMix Network, which brings together specialists from more than 50 countries, was instrumental in developing the company's first global brands and related value-added services, which now account for a third of Cemex's total revenue. The lesson? Change comes naturally when individuals have a platform that allows them to identify shared interests and to brainstorm solutions.

Change platforms take advantage of social technologies that make large-scale collaboration easy and effective. But they are qualitatively different from the idea wikis and social networks commonly used today. The difference isn't primarily about specific features; rather, it's in the encouragement individuals are given to use the platform to drive deep change. Specifically, effective change platforms:

Guiding a process of socially constructed change is neither quick nor easy--but it is possible and effective. The biggest obstacles to creating robust change platforms aren't technical. The challenge lies in shifting the role of the executive from change agent in chief to change enabler in chief. This means devoting leadership attention to the creation of an environment where deep, proactive change can happen anywhere--and at any time--and inspiring the entire organization to swarm the most pressing issues.

Change leaders from the NHS, Cemex, and several other organizations will discuss the challenge of ""changing how we change,"" at the 2014 MIX Mashup, in New York, from November 18 to November 20.

March 18, 2025Shoppers continue to enjoy online shopping, but e-commerce growth in the United States is slowing down, and consumer preferences have changed over the past two years.

In fact, a McKinsey survey found that 90 percent of customers are willing to wait at least two to three days for their deliveries if the shipping is free.

"25","BCBS 239 2.0 resurgence: Strengthening risk management and decision making","Asin Tavakoli , Holger Harreis , Kayvaun Rowshankish , Stephen Reddin","December 6, 2024","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/risk-and-resilience/our-insights/bcbs-239-2-0-resurgence-strengthening-risk-management-and-decision-making","5","The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) issued its standard number 239 (BCBS 239) nearly a dozen years ago in 2013, with the aim of strengthening banks' risk management through improved risk data aggregation and internal risk reporting. Its binding compliance deadline for global systemically important banks (G-SIBs) was nearly nine years ago, in January 2016. For domestic systemically important banks (D-SIBs), compliance was expected within three years following their designation as such.

However, full compliance remains elusive for many institutions; meanwhile, regulators are renewing their attention and applying an increasingly forceful approach. There's a broadening of scope in terms of which institutions are receiving regulatory attention--including Tier 2 and Tier 3 institutions. The assessments are also deepening in their application and level of detail across areas of policy, capability, and reporting. In Europe, they take the form of on-site inspections (OSIs), targeted reviews of priority areas, and assessments of data quality related to supervisory reporting. These actions often lead to significant penalties, including findings communicated in the form of European Central Bank (ECB) letters, Pillar 2 requirement (P2R) add-ons, restrictions on business activity, and fines. In the United States, assessments involve examinations of the data management practices of banks, along with evaluations of related areas such as regulatory reporting, resolution and recovery planning, and specific report examinations (for example, the Complex Institution Liquidity Monitoring Report, or FR 2052a). These assessments can result in matters requiring immediate attention (MRIAs) and matters requiring attention (MRAs); in the most severe situations, they may lead to consent orders. Across both Europe and the United States, beyond the direct penalties, there are cascading indirect financial consequences, such as conservatism add-ons in risk modeling, for example, margins of conservatism (MOC) for internal ratings-based (IRB) models.

According to the Bank for International Settlements, only two in 31 banks (G-SIBs) have fully complied with the standard; moreover, several formerly compliant banks have been downgraded. A series of progress reports--seven between 2013 and 2023--issued additional regulatory guidance. The sixth report, which in April 2020 called for the transition of enforcement to local regulators, was followed by a pause of approximately three years. This pause, however, concealed the growing pressure on banks to meet the expectations of local regulators. In Europe, this includes the issuance of ECB letters with findings, P2R add-ons, and fines. In the United States, banks face scrutiny from the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and the Federal Reserve Board, including MRIAs, MRAs, and, in severe cases, consent orders.

This pressure was ratcheted up considerably by the latest report in November 2023, which highlighted a lack of meaningful progress and issued significant expectations for banks and their supervisors. The report noted that BCBS 239 programs have been underfunded and lacking in attention from senior leadership, with insufficient recognition of the standard's importance in relation to capability improvement. It also pointed out a failure to embed the standard in relevant urgent programs, such as Basel IV/3.1. Contributing to the lack of progress, the report suggested, is a ""boil the ocean"" approach taken by some banks, with insufficient prioritization of requirements and misfires with regard to the scope of implementation. Technical factors, including fragmented IT ecosystems hampered by legacy systems, add to the struggle.

In addition to the BCBS 239 progress reports, regulatory bodies have called attention to related problems. The ECB's banking supervision identified risk data aggregation and risk reporting (RDARR) deficiencies in its December 2023 report on supervisory priorities for 2024-26. Likewise, its May 2024 Guide on effective risk data aggregation and risk reporting (Guide) conveyed a range of guidance, including highlighting the importance of basic data governance hygiene to ensure confidence in the numbers and reports issued by financial institutions, clearly defining what constitutes critical risk and finance information across various dimensions, prioritizing end-to-end automated lineage, and actively involving top management. The Guide also adds, for the first time, real practical guidance on essential requirements across seven areas--leaving no room for neglect.

We are aware of the obstacles encountered when endeavoring to manage risk-related data effectively. In line with the latest BCBS 239 progress report, we've identified a number of key challenges that need to be addressed. These include getting organizations with differing priorities and perspectives to work together, conducting thorough root-cause analysis to identify data issues in a context where data are pervasive throughout the bank, and aligning existing incentive structures to promote a strong data management culture. We have five core beliefs, along with ten key lessons (see sidebar, ""A blueprint for success""), about how banking organizations should orient their mindset when it comes to BCBS 239. By finding the right disposition toward the standard, financial institutions can position themselves well to undertake meaningful action. Consider these five guiding principles the foundation for an effective strategy blueprint--and as part of that blueprint, aim to create visibility for board and senior management with frequent progress reports.

It's crucial--and truly beneficial--to approach the BCBS 239 journey as a business impact story right from the beginning. This means the CFO, chief information officer (CIO), and chief risk officer (CRO) should be proactive in bringing the business leaders on board and linking the effort to specific business objectives that go beyond regulatory compliance. Leaders should highlight the opportunities that arise from more timely data and streamlined calculation processes in prioritized areas. Improved master and transactional data can unlock new commercialization opportunities. Additionally, improved model explainability can mitigate the impact of regulatory reviews. Leaders should develop a perspective focused on how initiatives can be linked and integrated with existing business-related efforts and programs.

Our experience suggests that practical implementation of such an approach entails interviewing business leaders at the outset to identify major data-related pain points and prioritize the respective remediation. This could include initiatives such as shedding excessive hedges and capital buffers currently in place due to insufficient timeliness of risk metrics or removing margins of conservatism while remaining within the boundaries established by risk modeling.

Leaders should identify and prioritize critical information, addressing these areas first to immediately mitigate the most significant risks. With the scope prioritized at the beginning, it can then be expanded in terms of both breadth and depth. For example, banks might begin with an initial prioritized scope in the form of select key regulatory reports and management metrics, focusing on data quality controls and the reduction of manual interventions in high-risk areas of the aggregation processes. Then, in time, the prioritized scope can expand to include a broader set of reports and metrics, with data quality controls across more points in the aggregation processes. In essence, this approach entails breaking the scope into manageable sizes while enabling the measurement of risk reduction in critical outputs.

Our experience suggests that the above can be achieved by ensuring risk and finance collaboration from the beginning of the program and tasking the respective areas with identifying the information most critical to them. This can then be conveyed in terms of common dimensions such as metrics, critical data elements (CDEs), and reports based on central guidance regarding what constitutes criticality. There should also be a focus on sharing/reusing CDEs across the metrics so that the population does not keep growing unnecessarily.

Leaders should look for opportunities to accelerate the execution of the approach described in principle 2. The use of generative AI (gen AI) tools can significantly accelerate data compliance and development efforts. In fact, leading organizations are deploying gen AI at scale to fix data quality issues and go beyond rule-based vendor products, enabling significant value through higher productivity.

We have observed that, as a starting point, banks can benefit from tools that help automate data lineage and transparency efforts to ensure base levels of compliance. This approach will also provide banks with a clear view of the gaps and issues in their data. With this in place, banks can take directed actions to remediate data issues. Next, banks should think through the entire data development life cycle to understand what types of tools and interventions are needed. Gen AI tools, for example, can help integrate data privacy and protection solutions during the data governance stage. Banks should consider experimenting with a suite of tools to build deployable data quality workflows--focusing not only on which ones can best support their development needs but also on those that can do so at scale.

Banks should aim to remediate data as far upstream in the data life cycle as possible, ideally at the point of origination. Ideally, they should move toward a target data architecture that relies on a limited number of authorized provisioning points (APPs) or authoritative data sources (ADSs). Implementing a robust set of data controls, preferably automated and preventative, early in the data process is crucial to ensure quality for downstream consumers. It is important to rigorously enforce the use of APPs and ADSs to ensure that high-quality data are sourced from a minimal set of systems. If existing data sources fail to meet consumer requirements, they should be upgraded, rather than creating new, redundant sources, which would require additional controls and governance to maintain data quality.

Experience tells us that most data quality issues originate from upstream systems in the data sources and at the consumption point. To address this, banks can, as part of their data operating model, map the data lineage from its point of origin to its consumption point. This enables evaluation of the existing data controls to determine their effectiveness and gather feedback on pain points from data consumers throughout the lineage--thus identifying where additional data controls and/or upgrades are necessary. Banks should consider implementing a comprehensive framework that outlines minimum preventative, detective, and corrective data quality control requirements for critical data along the end-to-end data lineage.

Banks should maintain a strong degree of proactiveness and transparency with regulators, ensuring they perceive the bank and the BCBS 239 program as models of openness and proactivity. To convey a strong sense of control and oversight, it is important to communicate in a highly structured manner, providing regular progress reports that offer comprehensive information on both the current status and upcoming initiatives. Insofar as possible, banks should implement initiatives of their own accord versus waiting for a regulatory push. This approach will enable the bank to set its own pace.

In our experience, this entails communicating early on the scope of the program--as well as the vision, ambition level, and execution approach (for example, deciding to first do a horizontal fix of all foundational aspects versus engaging a sprint-based method). Thereafter, this involves building and leveraging structured templates to communicate the current state (for example, gaps in critical metrics) and upcoming initiatives; likewise, it includes regular reporting on progress and bottlenecks. Where possible, banks should inform the regulator in an integrated way, such as by communicating BCBS 239-related initiatives and commitments as part of Basel IV/3.1 programs.

European and US banks vary widely in terms of where they stand on their BCBS 239 journeys. Some are just beginning, while others are refreshing their efforts or accelerating their progress. Those furthest along have been dedicated to compliance for several years. They have been closely monitoring key risk metrics and reports, with business and IT functions closely involved. Nevertheless, they face regulatory scrutiny, because BCBS 239 demands perpetual enhancements, such as the removal of manual processes and the widening of scope across dimensions of reports, models, risk indicators, and critical data elements, with the ultimate aim of covering all critical data of the bank.

Banks in the middle of their BCBS 239 compliance journey typically have well-documented frameworks, such as data governance structures, clearly defined scopes, and have begun exploring new tools. However, they often struggle to make swift, measurable progress and engage the business. Some of those just starting out have previous failed attempts behind them. The problem typically lies with execution: despite ambitious plans, practical implementation has proved elusive, and tooling sometimes emerges as an excuse.

The rewards are worth the effort. Banks are at an important moment in their regulatory journeys. With BCBS 239 getting renewed attention and the expectations rising rapidly, the pressure is on to make meaningful progress toward full compliance. By establishing a business impact mindset across the organization, these requirements can also become an opportunity for competitive advantage with a host of indirect financial benefits, including enhanced digitization initiatives, improved risk management, and bolstered relationships with regulators based on trust.

Works with private and social sector clients to strengthen individual, team, and company performance by inspiring a purpose-driven culture. Helps organizations unlock the full potential of their people by tapping into purpose and meaning to remove barriers that get in the way of the impact people want to derive from work

Advises consumer goods, pharmaceutical, biotechnology, and medical-product companies in driving holistic digital transformations and addressing strategic, operational, and growth challenges

September 30, 2019A medical device company undertook a large transformation that included integrating several business units to create one unified organization and culture. This was no small feat; at any given moment, the team, like many teams, had 100 or so projects running to execute the integration.

Managing change in these situations often feels extremely difficult, if not impossible. With thousands of employees and multiple rounds of simultaneous changes, how can top teams ensure everyone is adopting the new ways of working? This company's experience highlights three critical lessons on successfully managing change.

Focusing on operational success lowers the bar

Often when project plans are built, they are geared toward executing the project workstreams themselves and achieving operational success rather than achieving the bigger-picture outcome the project is intending to accomplish, or ""Ultimate Success."" For example, we've seen teams focus on setting up a new inventory management system rather than setting up a new inventory management system and ensuring people regularly use it. While this may seem like a nuance, the difference between the two is tremendous; the former could lead to neglecting the communication strategy during and after launch, which is critical to achieving the desired outcome and capturing value from the new system.

In the case of the medical devices company, the first thing the team did was identify the Ultimate Success in each project and ensure that each line of the project plan tracked to that goal. This exercise involved going from confirming the team sent an email to verifying that somebody read it.

The most basic activities can make--or break--a change program

While projects usually require changes in mind-set and behavior, some changes are more tactical in nature. Regardless of the type of change, a strong foundation in basic change-management activities--such as building stakeholder lists and communication plans--is critical. Unfortunately, these not-so-basics are often overlooked or assumed to be in place. Moving forward on a change effort without completing these activities is like building the walls of a house without a foundation; both are destined to crumble. As the company revamped its process, it built a detailed list of basic, non-negotiable change-management activities to execute, ensuring nothing would fall through the cracks.

As changes become more complex, the basics are still needed, but they become insufficient on their own. At this point, companies should work to uncover mind-sets, utilize the influence model to shift mind-sets and behaviors, and embed health to achieve Ultimate Success.

Change plans should evolve over time

Projects often feel like a game of Chutes and Ladders (with many chutes and virtually no ladders). Any time the project evolves or runs into an unforeseen roadblock, the team slides down a chute and goes back to square one in managing the project. But teams frequently have static change-management plans that are separate from their dynamic project plan. As soon as a change-management activity is finished, they check the box and move on to the next one.

When the medical devices company's project scope changed, the project plan was quickly adjusted. But since the change-management activities were allocated to a different plan, the team didn't, for example, recommunicate with stakeholders, as that box had been checked long ago.

Moving forward, the company created one integrated change and project plan, tying the change-management activities to project milestones and creating a living, breathing document.

Change is hard, and it's easy to get caught up in its complexity. However, at the end of the day, focusing on the not-so-basics can bring your transformation to a whole new level.

February 10, 2025Organizations and their leaders are turning to technology, including generative and agentic AI, to help navigate and solve the unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) they face. But the allure of ease through technology can be deceptive, and as technology evolves, leaders must evolve as well.

The future of work in the age of AI is ""VUCA on steroids."" Adding to today's economic pressures and geopolitical conflicts, no one knows how AI will change the world, nor how humans and AI will work together in the future. In addition, treating AI as just another tool to be implemented may put more stress on this already strained system, especially if organizations do not purposefully address the human aspects.

In this environment, leaders continuously face novel and complex challenges with no easy answers, and it can be tempting to default to tech-enabled, data-driven decisions. Part of gen AI's appeal is that, within seconds, it offers a seemingly straightforward answer to any question at the click of a button. Our brains are wired to prefer simple solutions, and AI caters to these natural tendencies in uncertain times. This deceptive simplicity tempts leaders into the comfort of using simple solutions rooted in past processes to address complex, novel challenges.

This loss of nuance and grey zones invites black-or-white thinking, polarization, and deepening of biases, which are further accentuated by the level of acceleration brought to work and life by AI. Leaders may see less diversity of thought in their workforce and less tolerance for constructive dissent that drives smart decision making and innovative problem solving.

This is not to say that AI deployment should not be pursued. Rather, technology deployment alone should not be the objective; the objective is a more sophisticated and capable organization. To balance these tendencies, leaders and their teams need to consciously grow their leadership capabilities. Instead of letting the organization be led by technology, leading in this new era of work requires investing in human capabilities--in particular, the ability to host complexity--alongside technological implementation.

Leaders can strengthen the ability to host complexity--both their own and their team's--through human-centric leadership. These five concrete leadership practices are a great place to start:

The AI age will shape how all companies operate. The challenge lies in determining how to best use technology, including to truly simplify--without losing the unique value that complexity offers, nor the ability for humans to engage with it.

As leaders define their organization's relationship with gen AI, the practices above can help leaders navigate the potential leadership traps of AI and lean into the ""both/and"" of humanity and technology.

Senior expert in the Mumbai office

Coleads McKinsey's Technology, Media & Telecommuni­cations Practice, where he advises technology companies on growth, M&A, and transformations

Solution leader for cloud delivery in the Atlanta office

March 12, 2024Updating network architecture to best meet a company's current needs can have dramatic effects. Modern network practices offer benefits and competitive advantages, such as accelerated time to market and enhanced customer experience through seamless and reliable interactions with cloud-native applications.

Consider one global technology conglomerate that undertook a network transformation, shifting from a legacy networking model to a microservices-based architecture. By embracing microservices and modern network principles, the conglomerate achieved a substantial reduction in deployment times for new services. This acceleration empowered the conglomerate to swiftly roll out innovations to the market and seize new business opportunities.

In a recent blog post, we wrote about how companies can make this delicate shift to cloud-native networks to ensure their networks are serving them in today's business landscape, which is marked by cybersecurity concerns, data expansion, and cloud migration, among other trends. In this post, we dig into some of the challenges of aligning network architectures with cloud-native principles and the change management practices that can help ensure that challenges don't get in the way of modernization efforts.

Companies often initiate programs to move to cloud-native networks, but they don't always complete them. In our experience, several hurdles can cause momentum to slow or stall:

Security concerns about the new network architecture. Many teams assume that being able to physically connect and disconnect devices allows for higher security. This is false. Internet-based connections offer more resilience compared with physical connections, and security protocols and network monitoring can allow companies to achieve, at the minimum, the same level of control as they have on a physical network.

Slow progress on network design. The transition phase of integrating existing firewalls and network configurations with the cloud-native network and its more agile development principles can be challenging. Sometimes this redesign can cause organizations to lose momentum; however, if they can overcome this one-time push, less effort will be required in the long term.

Insufficient talent to configure and integrate new network principles. Integrating new network principles often requires drastically different skill sets than what organizations typically have available. To address this, companies will want to consider reskilling their current workforce, as opposed to relying on a purely external workforce, for the integration effort.

By taking the following steps, companies can increase the chances that the transition gains traction and sticks, allowing them to achieve agility, innovation, and resilience in cloud-native applications.

Companies should commence with a thorough assessment of their existing network infrastructure, gaining a deep understanding of its strengths, weaknesses, and alignment with cloud-native objectives. In undertaking this assessment, companies often discover that their existing network infrastructure is not adequately aligned with cloud-native objectives, lacking the scalability, agility, and security required for modern applications. With this knowledge in hand, they can develop a robust modernization strategy that resonates with their overarching organizational goals and seamlessly integrates with their application landscape. To ensure successful capacity allocation, the assessment should also take stock of available talent and skills as well as the effort required to change the underlying network infrastructure.

Companies should invest in enhancing their network engineering team's expertise in cloud-native concepts and tools, offering comprehensive training that encompasses cloud networking, microservices communication, container orchestration, and the implementation of security best practices. The extent of training required will depend on the specific needs of the network engineering team and the organization's overall modernization goals, but organizations should expect to invest in significant training to bridge the gap between their existing expertise and the required cloud-native knowledge. Factors to consider include the team's experience, project complexity, cloud strategy, and internal training resources. Implementing training may require a phased approach, starting with foundational concepts and progressing to deeper training as the project progresses. The training should also include programs to change the underlying mindset of the network organization, including workshops dedicated to understanding the reservations of the existing organization and highlighting the benefits of the new technology setup.

Modernization journeys can begin with modest pilot projects. These focused initiatives allow organizations to test and validate network modernization approaches in a controlled environment. Pilot projects yield invaluable insights, shedding light on challenges, successes, and optimization strategies. The lessons learned from these pilots serve as a guide for the broader modernization landscape and the effort required to ensure successful planning.

Organizations will likely want to avoid using pilots for mission-critical projects with a high risk of failure that could significantly affect business operations, complex projects with a long timeline that may not be suitable for a pilot-first approach, and nonessential projects that do not directly contribute to the overall modernization goals and may divert resources from initiatives that are more vital. Instead, they could focus on conducting pilot projects to evaluate new technologies or approaches in a controlled environment, testing complex multiteam or multisystem projects to identify potential challenges, and validating critical aspects of the overall modernization strategy to ensure alignment with organizational goals.

Organizations should strive to foster a culture of collaboration in a holistic approach that unites network engineers, application developers, and security teams. Regular communication and collaborative decision making are instrumental in producing an elevated outcome. To make the required mindset change, the collaboration exercise--which should extend into the compliance and risk functions--should consider the journey of the organization and learning journey of the individual employees. The company may need to update and adopt policies and security guidelines to reflect that physical control of the entire network is neither required nor advisable. By taking this approach, organizations ensure that network modernization seamlessly harmonizes with other facets of application development and security protocols.

Network modernization is an ongoing evolution, demanding continuing evaluation and enhancement. Organizations should establish a robust feedback loop that encompasses vigilant monitoring, input from stakeholders, and periodic reviews. These reviews can include annual comprehensive assessments of performance, security, and alignment with evolving needs as well as monthly or quarterly check-ins to monitor key metrics, identify issues, and make proactive adjustments. Organizations will also inevitably need to conduct spontaneous reviews in reaction to security incidents or major network changes. Continuous improvement can help organizations ensure the network remains attuned to ever-evolving business demands and the rapid pace of technological advancements.

Applications drive business innovation, and the network enables this transformation. Embracing the shift toward microservices, containerization, and cloud-native architectures is not just a technical decision but also a strategic imperative. Network modernization paves the way for accelerated business outcomes, and strong change management in this effort is essential in positioning organizations to thrive in the dynamic landscape of the digital age.

March 17, 2025Only 16 percent of executives feel comfortable with the amount of technology talent they have available to drive their digital transformation, according to a 2023 internal McKinsey survey of 40 executives across sectors. The same survey found that 60 percent of companies cited the scarcity of tech talent and skills as a key inhibitor of that transformation.

The talent gap was also a central theme at our latest Tech Talent Roundtable in Frankfurt. This event, the third in our Tech Talent Roundtable series, brought together senior HR and IT leaders in Europe from across sectors, including technology and the media, energy and materials, finance, and the public sector.

While layoffs by major technology companies may have temporarily increased the pool of available tech talent, there is no evidence of a systematic narrowing of the gap between supply and demand. Results from the survey referenced above indicate that based on current trends, demand for tech talent is likely to be two to four times greater than supply over the coming years. Within the European Union alone, the tech talent gap could be 1.4 million to 3.9 million people by 2027.

Over the course of the roundtable, gen AI was repeatedly mentioned as a possible solution for the tech talent shortage due to its potential to increase workforce efficiency. Gen AI can improve product manager productivity by 40 percent (where the process of requirements specification is sufficiently automated), for example, and can halve the time it takes to document and code. So far, however, this potential has been realized only by leading companies that have invested in a significant degree of automation; most companies have yet to see efficiency improvements at this scale.

Despite the efficiency-improving potential of gen AI, there is currently no evidence that the technology is leading to a reduction in demand for tech talent. On the contrary: We see that the demand for technology talent has increased as companies invest in preparing the technological backbone needed for the effective deployment of AI tools. Roundtable participants noted that resources freed up through the increased efficiency of technology teams have mostly been redeployed to delivery teams, allowing these teams to expand their outputs.

In addition, the spread of gen AI has generated further demand for a subset of skills and talents. The full potential of gen AI can be realized only if it is both embedded appropriately and used effectively by a significant proportion of the workforce. These requirements did not apply to previous technologies, which means that a significant number of employees--many of whom may have limited technical knowledge--may need to be reskilled or upskilled. Many of the tools and output created by gen AI also need to be managed or interpreted by humans, which imposes additional talent needs. Currently, therefore, gen AI appears to add to rather than relieve the problem of talent shortages.

There will be no magic bullet solution for the current talent shortage. Instead, companies will need to address the issue holistically. In doing so, they could draw on four separate levers (exhibit).

In the past, many companies could meet their talent needs using a combination of two of the four levers: buying and outsourcing. Both levers will still be helpful, but they are unlikely to be enough in the current market.

As the gap between the supply and demand for talent widens, companies are increasingly focused on building the right talent or partnering to access it.

While the ultimate solution for filling talent gaps will likely involve all four levers, the immediate issue for many companies is how to get started. The first step will be to develop a clear view on each of the following:

Taken together, these elements will give companies a rounded view of where they are and where they need to be.

Demand for technology talent will exceed supply for the foreseeable future, and the talent gap is therefore likely to continue to be a major topic during future iterations of our Tech Talent Roundtable. However, companies that work to develop a clear baseline of their current situation and strategically employ a combination of all four workforce levers will be able to secure the talent they need.

"28","Changing change management","Boris Ewenstein , Wesley Smith , Ashvin Sologar","July 1, 2015","https://www.mckinsey.com/featured-insights/leadership/changing-change-management","1","Change management as it is traditionally applied is outdated. We know, for example, that 70 percent of change programs fail to achieve their goals, largely due to employee resistance and lack of management support. We also know that when people are truly invested in change it is 30 percent more likely to stick. While companies have been obsessing about how to use digital to improve their customer-facing businesses, the application of digital tools to promote and accelerate internal change has received far less scrutiny. However, applying new digital tools can make change more meaningful--and durable--both for the individuals who are experiencing it and for those who are implementing it.

The advent of digital change tools comes at just the right time. Organizations today must simultaneously deliver rapid results and sustainable growth in an increasingly competitive environment. They are being forced to adapt and change to an unprecedented degree: leaders have to make decisions more quickly; managers have to react more rapidly to opportunities and threats; employees on the front line have to be more flexible and collaborative. Mastering the art of changing quickly is now a critical competitive advantage.

For many organizations, a five-year strategic plan--or even a three-year one--is a thing of the past. Organizations that once enjoyed the luxury of time to test and roll out new initiatives must now do so in a compressed period while competing with tens or hundreds of existing (and often incomplete) initiatives. In this dynamic and fast-paced environment, competitive advantage will accrue to companies with the ability to set new priorities and implement new processes quicker than their rivals.

Large companies are increasingly engaged in multiple simultaneous change programs, often involving scores of people across numerous geographies. While traditional workshops and training courses have their place, they are not effective at scale and are slow moving.

B2C companies have unlocked powerful digital tools to enhance the customer journey and shift consumer behavior. Wearable technology, adaptive interfaces, and integration into social platforms are all areas where B2C companies have innovated to make change more personal and responsive. Some of these same digital tools and techniques can be applied with great effectiveness to change-management techniques within an organization. Digital dashboards and personalized messages, for example, can build faster, more effective support for new behaviors or processes in environments where management capacity to engage deeply and frequently with every employee is constrained by time and geography.

Digitizing five areas in particular can help make internal change efforts more effective and enduring.

The best feedback processes are designed to offer the right information when the recipient can actually act on it. Just-in-time feedback gives recipients the opportunity to make adjustments to their behavior and to witness the effects of these adjustments on performance.

Consider the experience of a beverage company experiencing sustained share losses and stagnant market growth in a highly competitive market in Africa. The challenge was to motivate 1,000-plus sales representatives to sell with greater urgency and effectiveness. A simple SMS message system was implemented to keep the widely distributed sales reps, often on the road for weeks at a time, plugged into the organization. Each rep received two to three daily SMS messages with personalized performance information, along with customer and market insights. For example, one message might offer feedback on which outlets had placed orders below target; another would alert the rep to a situation that indicated a need for increased orders, such as special events or popular brands that were trending in the area. Within days of implementing the system, cross-selling and upselling rates increased to more than 50 percent from 4 percent, and within the first year, the solution delivered a $25 million increase in gross margin, which helped to swing a 1.5 percent market-share loss into a 1 percent gain.

Personalization is about filtering information in a way that is uniquely relevant to the user and showing each individual's role in and contribution to a greater group goal. An easy-to-use system can be an effective motivator and engender positive peer pressure.

This worked brilliantly for a rail yard looking to reduce the idle time of its engines and cars by up to 10 percent. It implemented a system that presented only the most relevant information to each worker at that moment, such as details on the status of a train under that worker's supervision, the precise whereabouts of each of the trains in the yard, or alerts indicating which train to work on. Providing such specific and relevant information helped workers clarify priorities, increase accountability, and reduce delays.

Creating direct connections among people across the organization allows them to sidestep cumbersome hierarchal protocols and shorten the time it takes to get things done. It also fosters more direct and instant connections that allow employees to share important information, find answers quickly, and get help and advice from people they trust.

In the rail-yard example, a new digital communications platform was introduced to connect relevant parties right away, bypassing middlemen and ensuring that issues get resolved quickly and efficiently. For example, if the person in charge of the rail yard has a question about the status of an incoming train, he or she need only log into the system and tap the train icon to pose the question directly to the individuals working on that train. Previously, all calls and queries had to be routed through a central source. This ability to bridge organizational divides is a core advantage in increasing agility, collaboration, and effectiveness.

In increasingly global organizations, communities involved in change efforts are often physically distant from one another. Providing an outlet for colleagues to share and see all the information related to a task, including progress updates and informal commentary, can create an important esprit de corps.

Specific tools are necessary to achieve this level of connectivity and commitment. Those that we have seen work well include shared dashboards, visualizations of activity across the team, ""gamification"" to bolster competition, and online forums where people can easily speak to one another (for example, linking a Twitter-like feed to a work flow or creating forums tied to leaderboards so people can easily discuss how to move up in the rankings).

This approach worked particularly well with a leading global bank aiming to reduce critical job vacancies. The sourcing team made the HR process a shared experience, showing all stakeholders the end-to-end view--dashboards identifying vacancies; hiring requisitions made and approved; candidates identified, tested, and interviewed; offers made and accepted; and hire letters issued. This transparency and openness built a shared commitment to getting results, a greater willingness to deliver on one's own step in the process, and a greater willingness to help one another beyond functional boundaries.

Organizational change is like turning a ship: the people at the front can see the change but the people at the back may not notice for a while. Digital change tools are helpful in this case to communicate progress so that people can see what is happening in real time. More sophisticated tools can also show individual contributions toward the common goal. We have seen how this type of communication makes the change feel more urgent and real, which in turn creates momentum that can help push an organization to a tipping point where a new way of doing things becomes the way things are done.

Digital tools and platforms, if correctly applied, offer a powerful new way to accelerate and amplify the ability of an organization to change. However, let's be clear: the tool should not drive the solution. Each company should have a clear view of the new behavior it wants to reinforce and find a digital solution to support it. The best solutions are tightly focused on a specific task and are rolled out only after successful pilots are completed. The chances of success increase when management actively encourages feedback from users and incorporates it to give them a sense of ownership in the process.

August 6, 2018When it comes to evolution, ""it is not the strongest or the most intelligent who will survive but those who can best manage change,"" maintained naturalist Charles Darwin.

So it is with modernizing and changing operating models within organizations. This can often be met with resistance by employees and exasperated further by cultural influences. In Japan, consensus building is a strong part of the culture and change management programs fail primarily from employee resistance at the second level beneath the CEO and teams.

To combat this, one newly installed CEO - brought in to make changes at a Japanese consumer products company - immediately formed a team that would reach Level 2 employees. He handpicked younger people more likely to change and adapt and did not include disinterested veteran leaders.

Two significant things happened. First, the CEO spent considerable time educating the new team on the journey ahead, explaining how the organization would function so they could envision the company's future. Second, by handpicking a younger team, the message to company veterans was that something important was happening, and leaders who accepted these new changes would be part of the company's success.

A few core elements helped this organization achieve the right results:

Our experience supporting change efforts in Japanese organizations suggests we find success when more attention is paid to culturally attuned principles, as in the above example. For similarly consensus-oriented organizations, here are four practical ways to drive change.

Establishing a purposeful team upfront helps sustain change and embeds the new procedural and cultural elements in the new model. In this context, the so-called ""third generation"" of leaders - those roughly 35-45 years in age who realize they have a future to build, not a legacy to protect - is becoming an important source of change energy because they're more risk-seeking.

Staying culturally attuned promises to make a big difference in whether organizations in Japan or elsewhere succeed in their change management mission.

February 10, 2025Organizations and their leaders are turning to technology, including generative and agentic AI, to help navigate and solve the unprecedented volatility, uncertainty, complexity, and ambiguity (VUCA) they face. But the allure of ease through technology can be deceptive, and as technology evolves, leaders must evolve as well.

The future of work in the age of AI is ""VUCA on steroids."" Adding to today's economic pressures and geopolitical conflicts, no one knows how AI will change the world, nor how humans and AI will work together in the future. In addition, treating AI as just another tool to be implemented may put more stress on this already strained system, especially if organizations do not purposefully address the human aspects.

In this environment, leaders continuously face novel and complex challenges with no easy answers, and it can be tempting to default to tech-enabled, data-driven decisions. Part of gen AI's appeal is that, within seconds, it offers a seemingly straightforward answer to any question at the click of a button. Our brains are wired to prefer simple solutions, and AI caters to these natural tendencies in uncertain times. This deceptive simplicity tempts leaders into the comfort of using simple solutions rooted in past processes to address complex, novel challenges.

This loss of nuance and grey zones invites black-or-white thinking, polarization, and deepening of biases, which are further accentuated by the level of acceleration brought to work and life by AI. Leaders may see less diversity of thought in their workforce and less tolerance for constructive dissent that drives smart decision making and innovative problem solving.

This is not to say that AI deployment should not be pursued. Rather, technology deployment alone should not be the objective; the objective is a more sophisticated and capable organization. To balance these tendencies, leaders and their teams need to consciously grow their leadership capabilities. Instead of letting the organization be led by technology, leading in this new era of work requires investing in human capabilities--in particular, the ability to host complexity--alongside technological implementation.

Leaders can strengthen the ability to host complexity--both their own and their team's--through human-centric leadership. These five concrete leadership practices are a great place to start:

The AI age will shape how all companies operate. The challenge lies in determining how to best use technology, including to truly simplify--without losing the unique value that complexity offers, nor the ability for humans to engage with it.

As leaders define their organization's relationship with gen AI, the practices above can help leaders navigate the potential leadership traps of AI and lean into the ""both/and"" of humanity and technology.

"30","The psychology of change management","Emily Lawson , Colin Price","June 1, 2003","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-psychology-of-change-management","1","Over the past 15 or so years, programs to improve corporate organizational performance have become increasingly common. Yet they are notoriously difficult to carry out. Success depends on persuading hundreds or thousands of groups and individuals to change the way they work, a transformation people will accept only if they can be persuaded to think differently about their jobs. In effect, CEOs must alter the mind-sets of their employees--no easy task.

CEOs could make things easier for themselves if, before embarking on complex performance-improvement programs, they determined the extent of the change required to achieve the business outcomes they seek. Broadly speaking, they can choose among three levels of change. On the most straightforward level, companies act directly to achieve outcomes, without having to change the way people work; one example would be divesting noncore assets to focus on the core business. On the next level of complexity, employees may need to adjust their practices or to adopt new ones in line with their existing mind-sets in order to reach, say, a new bottom-line target. An already ""lean"" company might, for instance, encourage its staff to look for new ways to reduce waste, or a company committed to innovation might form relationships with academics to increase the flow of ideas into the organization and hence the flow of new products into the market.

But what if the only way a business can reach its higher performance goals is to change the way its people behave across the board? Suppose that it can become more competitive only by changing its culture fundamentally--from being reactive to proactive, hierarchical to collegial, or introspective to externally focused, for instance. Since the collective culture of an organization, strictly speaking, is an aggregate of what is common to all of its group and individual mind-sets, such a transformation entails changing the minds of hundreds or thousands of people. This is the third and deepest level: cultural change.

In such cases, CEOs will likely turn for help to psychology. Although breakthroughs have been made in explaining why people think and behave as they do, these insights have in general been applied to business only piecemeal and haven't had a widespread effect. Recently, however, several companies have found that linking all of the major discoveries together in programs to improve performance has brought about startling changes in the behavior of employees--changes rooted in new mind-sets. Performance-improvement programs that apply all of these ideas in combination can be just as chaotic and hard to lead as those that don't. But they have a stronger chance of effecting long-term changes in business practice and thus of sustaining better outcomes.

Employees will alter their mind-sets only if they see the point of the change and agree with it--at least enough to give it a try. The surrounding structures (reward and recognition systems, for example) must be in tune with the new behavior. Employees must have the skills to do what it requires. Finally, they must see people they respect modeling it actively. Each of these conditions is realized independently; together they add up to a way of changing the behavior of people in organizations by changing attitudes about what can and should happen at work.

In 1957 the Stanford social psychologist Leon Festinger published his theory of cognitive dissonance, the distressing mental state that arises when people find that their beliefs are inconsistent with their actions--agnostic priests would be an extreme example. Festinger observed in the subjects of his experimentation a deep-seated need to eliminate cognitive dissonance by changing either their actions or their beliefs.

The implication of this finding for an organization is that if its people believe in its overall purpose, they will be happy to change their individual behavior to serve that purpose--indeed, they will suffer from cognitive dissonance if they don't. But to feel comfortable about change and to carry it out with enthusiasm, people must understand the role of their actions in the unfolding drama of the company's fortunes and believe that it is worthwhile for them to play a part. It isn't enough to tell employees that they will have to do things differently. Anyone leading a major change program must take the time to think through its ""story""--what makes it worth undertaking--and to explain that story to all of the people involved in making change happen, so that their contributions make sense to them as individuals.

B. F. Skinner is best known for his experiments with rats during the late 1920s and the 1930s. He found that he could motivate a rat to complete the boring task of negotiating a maze by providing the right incentive--corn at the maze's center--and by punishing the rat with an electric shock each time it took a wrong turn.

Skinner's theories of conditioning and positive reinforcement were taken up by psychologists interested in what motivates people in organizations. Organizational designers broadly agree that reporting structures, management and operational processes, and measurement procedures--setting targets, measuring performance, and granting financial and nonfinancial rewards--must be consistent with the behavior that people are asked to embrace. When a company's goals for new behavior are not reinforced, employees are less likely to adopt it consistently; if managers are urged to spend more time coaching junior staff, for instance, but coaching doesn't figure in the performance scorecards of managers, they are not likely to bother.

Some disciples of Skinner suggest that positive-reinforcement ""loops"" have a constant effect: once established, you can leave them be. Over time, however, Skinner's rats became bored with corn and began to ignore the electric shocks. In our experience, a similar phenomenon often prevents organizations from sustaining higher performance: structures and processes that initially reinforce or condition the new behavior do not guarantee that it will endure. They need to be supported by changes that complement the other three conditions for changing mind-sets.

Many change programs make the error of exhorting employees to behave differently without teaching them how to adapt general instructions to their individual situation. The company may urge them to be ""customer-centric,"" for example, but if it paid little attention to customers in the past, they will have no idea how to interpret this principle or won't know what a successful outcome would look like.

How can adults best be equipped with the skills they need to make relevant changes in behavior? First, give them time. During the 1980s, David Kolb, a specialist in adult learning, developed his four-phase adult-learning cycle. Kolb showed that adults can't learn merely by listening to instructions; they must also absorb the new information, use it experimentally, and integrate it with their existing knowledge. In practice, this means that you can't teach everything there is to know about a subject in one session. Much better to break down the formal teaching into chunks, with time in between for the learners to reflect, experiment, and apply the new principles. Large-scale change happens only in steps.

Second, as the organizational psychologist Chris Argyris showed, people assimilate information more thoroughly if they go on to describe to others how they will apply what they have learned to their own circumstances. The reason, in part, is that human beings use different areas of the brain for learning and for teaching.1

Most clinical work confirms the idea that consistent role models, whom the famous pediatrician Benjamin Spock regarded as decisive for the development of children, are as important in changing the behavior of adults as the three other conditions combined. In any organization, people model their behavior on ""significant others"": those they see in positions of influence. Within a single organization, people in different functions or levels choose different role models--a founding partner, perhaps, or a trade union representative, or the highest-earning sales rep. So to change behavior consistently throughout an organization, it isn't enough to ensure that people at the top are in line with the new ways of working; role models at every level must ""walk the talk.""

The way role models deal with their tasks can vary, but the underlying values informing their behavior must be consistent. In a company that encourages entrepreneurial decision making at low levels, one middle manager might try to coach junior employees to know how to spot a promising new venture; another might leave this up to them. Both, however, would be acting in line with the entrepreneurial principle, whereas a boss who demanded a lengthy business case to justify each $50 expenditure would not be. But organizations trying to change their value systems can't tolerate as much variance in their role models' behavior. If entrepreneurial decision making were a new value, both of these middle managers might have to act in roughly the same way in order to encourage their subordinates to make bold decisions.

Behavior in organizations is deeply affected not only by role models but also by the groups with which people identify. Role modeling by individuals must therefore be confirmed by the groups that surround them if it is to have a permanent or deep influence. (Most teenagers could tell you a lot about this.) Say that a well-respected senior leader is waxing lyrical about making the culture less bureaucratic and even conforming to the new regime by making fewer requests for information. If the sales reps in the company canteen spend every lunchtime complaining that ""we've heard this a thousand times before and nothing happened,"" individuals will feel less pressure to change their behavior. Change must be meaningful to key groups at each level of the organization.

The case of a retail bank shows how these four conditions can coalesce to change mind-sets and behavior and thereby improve performance. But though we have grouped the actions of the bank under the four conditions, it didn't apply them in a neat sequence. As in any change program, there was much disruption and risk. Nonetheless, basing the program on four proven principles gave the CEO confidence that it would eventually succeed.

A few years ago, this CEO took the helm of a large European retail bank that employed more than 30,000 people. He set several targets: doubling the economic profit of the bank, reducing its cost-to-income ratio to 49 percent (from 56), and increasing its annual revenue growth from the current 1 to 2 percent to 5 to 7 percent--all within four years. But retail banking is almost a commodity business. No financial-engineering shortcuts or superficial changes in practice could win a competitive edge for the bank. It could meet these performance goals, the CEO realized, only by galvanizing its people to deliver far better customer outcomes at a much lower cost. That meant changing the culture of the bank by transforming it from a bureaucracy into a federation of entrepreneurs: managers would be rewarded for taking charge of problems and deciding, quickly, how to fix them.

First, the CEO developed these insights into a story that would make sense to all of the bank's employees, top to bottom, and would persuade them to change their behavior in line with the new principles. His principal technique was dialogue-based planning, a refinement of double-loop learning (see sidebar, ""People want to develop,"" for a different technique). First, he drafted a top-level story of the way he perceived the bank's position and refined the story with the help of his executive directors. Each of them in turn developed a chapter of the story relevant to his or her direct reports; the human-resources director, for example, explained how she would improve the system for identifying potential highfliers and redraw their career paths so that they would spend less time in low-impact jobs. Every director assigned responsibility for each ""deliverable"" in the story to one member of his or her team. Each team member then had to develop a performance scorecard setting out what he or she would do differently to meet the new goals.

The directors and the CEO then met again to retell their chapters and to get feedback from one another. Each director shared the amended version with his or her subordinates, who in turn retold the relevant part of the story to their own direct reports, and so on down five levels of the organization to the branch managers. At each retelling, the emphasis was on making the story meaningful to the people listening to it and to the groups to which they belonged.

At every level, information flowed upstream as well as down. Part of the story told by the director of retail operations, for example, was the customers' desire for faster banking processes. One thing slowing them down, according to the staff of the branches, was the document imagers, which broke down, on average, every three days. Ordering a new imager thus became a detail in each branch manager's story, and the branch staff could translate the top-level story--""our customers want faster operations""--into a practical result that also made their lives easier. At each level of the organization, an employee heard the relevant version of the proposed changes from his or her immediate boss, the person widely regarded as the most effective communications channel.2

How could the CEO know that people really bought into his story? The secret, he felt, was to ensure that it described how life would be better for all of the bank's stakeholders, not just investors and analysts.

The most dramatic structural change at the bank was eliminating 20 percent of its managerial jobs. The hypothesis, later proved correct, was that doing so would remove a swath of useless activity, without any falloff in performance. All of the bank's managerial jobs were terminated, and managers were invited to apply for the remaining 80 percent. Applicants knew that they had succeeded if they were invited to a dialogue-based planning session--another way of signaling the importance of the process. Unsuccessful candidates left the bank. The goal was not, primarily, to improve the bank's cost-to-income ratio; on the contrary, the cost of laying them off was quite high. Rather, since fewer managers now had to make the same number of decisions, this move was intended to force the survivors to make them more quickly.

Simultaneously, the bank's performance-management process was sharpened. Under the old system, managers were rated from 1 to 5 each year and remunerated accordingly. On average, 84 percent of them got a rating of 3 or more, though the performance of the bank was hardly as good as those results would imply. It injected reality into the process by introducing rankings within cohorts. To reveal the true relative performance of the bank's employees, a manager assessing ten people, say, could rank no more than three as top performers and had to put at least one person in the lowest level. The ten directors evaluated the top 50 managers in meetings chaired by the CEO. The bonus for gaining the first rank was increased to 20 percent, from 10. Managers in the lowest rank, who would formerly have received a bonus of 5 percent, got none at all. Those who consistently ranked in the lowest level were asked to leave.

There was more drama to come. After four months of developing the new strategy with the ten directors, the CEO realized that only five of them were committed to change and equipped to see it through. To ensure that his bank had the right skills to change its practices and culture, he replaced the other five with new directors, three of them outsiders.

Meanwhile, the top 50 managers spent two days at a skill-development center where their leadership abilities--in coaching and decision making, for example--were assessed, and each drew up a personal plan to develop those talents. The company began to assess the performance of its people not just on whether they ""made the numbers"" but also on the leadership dimension. One manager who had consistently won high bonuses was known to be hell to work for, a fact acknowledged by the new measurement scheme: he was paid the lowest sum appropriate to his post. This news, which traveled fast on the grapevine, underlined the message that leadership really counted.

Dialogue-based planning ensured that leaders at each level of the organization were ""singing from the same song sheet."" Their planning sessions were high-profile events where they themselves started modeling the new type of behavior that the bank wanted its staff to adopt. The CEO's enthusiasm also inspired employees to behave differently. He convinced them that although change would take a long time and would be very hard to achieve, his passion for improving the life of everyone involved with the bank was heartfelt.

Both messages came through strongly in the way he reshaped his executive team. The five departing directors left just as the most disruptive changes were starting, and the work of the remaining five became even more intense during the six months it took to find replacements. It would have caused far less chaos to search for them while leaving the old team in place--and in the dark--but the CEO's conscience told him not to do so. Besides showing other managers that there was nothing soft about the change program, his approach demonstrated his integrity and his respect for the needs of all of the bank's people, even those he didn't want to keep in the long term. In such a large-scale change in behavior, the leader's character and integrity matter enormously.

The bank, which is now two years into its four-year improvement timetable, is about halfway toward meeting its targets for reducing its cost-to-income ratio and increasing its revenue and economic profit. This achievement is a sure sign that behavior is heading in the intended direction throughout the bank. Does it prove that mind-sets too are changing? No numerical evidence is available, but from close observation we can see that the culture really has evolved. The bank isn't a comfortable place to work, but the focus on performance is far stronger, functional silos are being broken down, and people treat every task with far more urgency. A small but indicative example: average queuing times in branches have dropped by over 30 percent, largely because branch managers can count on their employees to work a more flexible shift system by making the most of part-time work and temporary cover. The imagers are working as well.

It is neither easy nor straightforward to improve a company's performance through a comprehensive program to change the behavior of employees by changing their mind-sets. No company should try to do so without first exhausting less disruptive alternatives for attaining the business outcome it desires. Sometimes tactical moves will be enough; sometimes new practices can be introduced without completely rethinking the corporate culture. But if the only way for a company to reach a higher plane of performance is to alter the way its people think and act, it will need to create the four conditions for achieving sustained change.

"31","The irrational side of change management","Carolyn Dewar , Scott Keller","April 1, 2009","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/the-irrational-side-of-change-management","1","In 1996, John Kotter published Leading Change. Considered by many to be the seminal work in the field of change management, Kotter's research revealed that only 30 percent of change programs succeed. Since the book's release, literally thousands of books and journal articles have been published on the topic, and courses dedicated to managing change are now part of many major MBA programs. Yet in 2008, a McKinsey survey of 3,199 executives around the world found, as Kotter did, that only one transformation in three succeeds. Other studies over the past ten years reveal remarkably similar results. It seems that, despite prolific output, the field of change management hasn't led to more successful change programs.

It also hasn't helped that most academics and practitioners now agree on the building blocks for influencing employee attitudes and management behavior. McKinsey's Emily Lawson and Colin Price provided a holistic perspective in ""The psychology of change management,"" which suggests that four basic conditions are necessary before employees will change their behavior: a) a compelling story, because employees must see the point of the change and agree with it; b) role modeling, because they must also see the CEO and colleagues they admire behaving in the new way; c) reinforcing mechanisms, because systems, processes, and incentives must be in line with the new behavior; and d) capability building, because employees must have the skills required to make the desired changes.

This prescription is well grounded in the field of psychology and is entirely rational. One of its merits is its intuitive appeal: many managers feel that, once revealed, it is simply good common sense. And this, we believe, is precisely where things go wrong. The prescription is right, but rational managers who attempt to put the four conditions in place by applying ""common sense"" typically misdirect time and energy, create messages that miss the mark, and experience frustrating unintended consequences from their efforts to influence change. Why? Because when they implement the prescription, they disregard certain, sometimes irrational--but predictable--elements of human nature.

In our research and by working with companies attempting change, we have identified nine insights into how human nature gets in the way of successfully applying the four conditions required for behavioral change. As we describe these insights, we'll show how various companies have, either by conscious awareness or simple luck, overcome or leveraged counterintuitive sides of human behavior in making change happen.

Change-management thinking extols the virtues of creating a compelling change story, communicating it to employees, and following it up with ongoing communications and involvement. This is good advice, but in practice there are three pitfalls to achieving the desired impact.

1. What motivates you doesn't motivate most of your employees. We see two types of change stories consistently told in organizations. The first is the ""good to great"" story: something along the lines of, ""Our historical advantage has been eroded by intense competition and changing customer needs; if we change, we can regain our leadership position."" The second is the turnaround story: ""We're performing below industry standard and must change dramatically to survive. We can become a top-quartile performer in our industry by exploiting our current assets and earning the right to grow.""

These stories both seem intuitively rational, yet they too often fail to have the impact that change leaders desire. Research by a number of leading thinkers in the social sciences, such as Danah Zohar, has shown that when managers and employees are asked what motivates them the most in their work they are equally split among five forms of impact--impact on society (for instance, building the community and stewarding resources), impact on the customer (for example, providing superior service), impact on the company and its shareholders, impact on the working team (for example, creating a caring environment), and impact on ""me"" personally (my development, paycheck, and bonus).

This finding has profound implications for leaders. What the leader cares about (and typically bases at least 80 percent of his or her message to others on) does not tap into roughly 80 percent of the workforce's primary motivators for putting extra energy into the change program. Change leaders need to be able to tell a change story that covers all five things that motivate employees. In doing so, they can unleash tremendous amounts of energy that would otherwise remain latent in the organization.

Consider a cost reduction program at a large US financial-services company. The program started with a change story that ticked the conventional boxes related to the company's competitive position and future. Three months into the program, management was frustrated with employee resistance. The change team worked together to recast the story to include an element related to society (to deliver affordable housing, for example), customers (fewer errors, more competitive prices), the company (expenses are growing faster than revenues, which is not sustainable), working teams (less duplication, more delegation), and individuals (more attractive jobs).

This relatively simple shift in approach lifted employee motivation measures from 35.4 percent to 57.1 percent in a month, and the program went on to achieve 10 percent efficiency improvements in the first year--a run rate far above initial expectations.

2. You're better off letting them write their own story. Well-intentioned leaders invest significant time in communicating their change story. Road shows, town halls, and Web sites are but a few of the many approaches typically used. Certainly the story (told in five ways) needs to get out there, but the insight we are offering is that much of the energy invested in communicating it would be better spent listening, not telling.

In a famous behavioral experiment, half the participants are randomly assigned a lottery ticket number while the others are asked to write down any number they would like on a blank ticket. Just before drawing the winning number, the researchers offer to buy back the tickets from their holders. The result: no matter what geography or demographic environment the experiment has taken place in, researchers have always found that they have to pay at least five times more to those who came up with their own number.

This reveals something about human nature: when we choose for ourselves, we are far more committed to the outcome (almost by a factor of five to one). Conventional approaches to change management underestimate this impact. The rational thinker sees it as a waste of time to let others discover for themselves what he or she already knows--why not just tell them and be done with it? Unfortunately this approach steals from others the energy needed to drive change that comes through a sense of ownership of the answer.

At BP, to develop a comprehensive training program for frontline leaders, a decision was made to involve every key constituency in the design of the program, giving them a sense of ""writing their own lottery ticket."" It took a year and a half to complete the design using this model but was well worth it: now in implementation, the program is the highest rated of its kind at BP. More than 250 active senior managers from across the business willingly teach the course, and, most important, managers who have been through the training program are consistently ranked higher in perfor-mance than those who haven't, both by their bosses and by the employees who report to them.

3. It takes a story with both + and - to create real energy. The ""deficit based"" approach--which identifies the problem, analyzes what's wrong and how to fix it, plans, and then takes action--has become the model predominantly taught in business schools and is presumably the default change model in most organizations. Research has shown, however, that a story focused on what's wrong invokes blame and creates fatigue and resistance, doing little to engage people's passion and experience.

This has led to the rise of the ""constructionist based"" approach to change, where the change process is based on discovery (discovering the best of what is), dreaming (imagining what might be), designing (talking about what should be), and destiny (creating what will be). The problem with this approach is that an overemphasis on the positive can lead to watered-down aspirations and impact. The reason is that, as humans, we are more willing to take risks to avoid losing what we've got than we are to gain something more. Some anxiety is useful when it comes to spurring behavioral change.

We believe the field of change management has drawn an artificial divide between deficit-based and constructionist-based approaches and stories. While it is impossible to prescribe generally how the divide should be split between positive and negative messages (as it will be specific to the context of any given change program), we strongly advise managers not to swing the pendulum too far in one direction or another. Consider Jack Welch, former CEO at GE, who took questions of ""what's wrong here?"" (poorly performing businesses, silo-driven behavior, and so forth) head-on, as well as ""imagining what might be"" (number one or two in every business, openness, and accountability).

Conventional change management suggests leaders should take actions that role model the desired change and mobilize a group of influence leaders to drive change deep into the organization. Unfortunately, this does not necessarily deliver the desired impact.

4. Leaders believe mistakenly that they already ""are the change."" Most senior executives understand and generally buy into Gandhi's famous aphorism, ""Be the change you want to see in the world."" They commit themselves to personally role modeling the desired behaviors. And then, in practice, nothing significant changes.

The reason for this is that most executives don't count themselves among the ones who need to change. How many executives when asked privately will say no to the question, ""Are you customer focused?"" and yes to the question ""Are you a bureaucrat?"" Of course, none. The fact is that human beings consistently think they are better than they are--a phenomenon referred to in psychology as a self-serving bias. Consider that 94 percent of men rank themselves in the top half according to male athletic ability. Whereas conventional change-management approaches surmise that top team role modeling is a matter of will or skill, the truth is that the real bottleneck to role modeling is knowing what to change at a personal level.

Typically, insight into what to change can be created by concrete 360-degree feedback techniques, either via surveys, conversations, or both. Look at Amgen CEO Kevin Sharer's approach of asking each of his top 75, ""What should I do differently?"" and then sharing his development needs and commitment publicly with them. Consider the top team of a national insurance company who routinely employed what they called the circle of fire during their change program: every participant receives feedback live--directly from their colleagues--in relation to being the change, such as ""What makes you great?"" and ""What holds you back?""

5. ""Influence leaders"" aren't a panacea for making change happen. Almost all change-management literature places importance on identifying and mobilizing those in the organization who either by role or personality (or both) have disproportionate influence over how others think and behave. We believe this is sound and timeless advice. However, we have observed that the role of influence leaders has gradually shifted--from being perceived as a helpful element of a broader set of interventions, to a panacea for making change happen.

Our experiences working with change programs suggest that success depends less on how persuasive a few selected leaders are and more on how receptive the ""society"" is to the idea. In practice it is often unexpected members of the rank and file who feel compelled to step up and make a difference in driving change. That's why we warn against overinvesting in influence leaders and advocate that change leaders' attention should be balanced across the right application of all four conditions for change, to ensure they reinforce each other in ways that maximize the probability of the change spark taking off like wildfire across the organization.

Conventional change management emphasizes the importance of reinforcing and embedding desired changes in structures, processes, systems, target setting, and incentives. We agree. To be effective, however, these mechanisms must take into account that people don't always behave rationally.

6. Money is the most expensive way to motivate people. Companies that try to link the objectives of change programs to the compensation of staff find that it rarely enhances their motivation for change to the extent desired. The reason for this is as practical as it is psychological in nature. The reality is that in the vast majority of companies, it is exceedingly difficult to incorporate a meaningful link to the change program within compensation systems that are based on a vast array of metrics. Moreover, many studies have found that for human beings satisfaction equals perception minus expectation (an equation often accompanied by the commentary, ""reality has nothing to do with it"").

The beauty of this equation for change managers is that small, unexpected rewards can have disproportionate effects on employees' satisfaction with a change program. Gordon M. Bethune, while turning around Continental Airlines, sent an unexpected $65 check to every employee when Continental made it to the top five for on-time airlines. John McFarlane, former CEO of ANZ Bank, sent a bottle of champagne to every employee for Christmas with a card thanking them for their work on the company's ""Perform, Grow, and Break-out"" change program. Most change managers would refer to these as merely token gestures and argue that their impact is limited and shortlived. Employees on the receiving end beg to differ. Indeed, they consistently report back that the rewards have a disproportionately positive impact on change motivation that lasts for months, if not years.

7. The process and the outcome have got to be fair. Employees will go against their own self-interest if the situation violates other notions they have about fairness and justice. Consider a bank, which, as part of a major change program, created new risk-adjusted return on capital (RAROC) models and delivered the resulting new pricing schedules to the front line along with new and appropriate sales incentives. The result: customer attrition (not only of the unprofitable ones) and price overrides went through the roof and significant value was destroyed by the effort. What went wrong? Because the frontline bankers perceived the changes as unfair to the customer, a significant number of them vocally bad-mouthed the bank's policies to customers and used price overrides to show their good faith, even though it meant they were less likely to achieve individual sales goals.

In making any changes to company structures, processes, systems, and incentives, change managers should pay what might strike them as an unreasonable amount of attention to employees' sense of the fairness of the change process and its intended outcome. Particular care should be taken where changes affect how employees interact with one another (such as head count reductions and talent-management processes) and with customers (sales stimulation programs, call center redesigns, and pricing). Ironically, in the pricing example described above, the outcome was inherently fair (customers are being asked to pay commensurate to the risk the bank is taking on), and therefore the downward spiral described could have been avoided (and has been by other banks adopting RAROC-based pricing) by carefully tending to employees' perceptions of fairness in the communications and training surrounding the changes.

Change-management literature emphasizes the importance of building the skills and talent needed for the desired change. Though hard to argue with, in practice there are two insights that demand attention in order to succeed.

8. Employees are what they think, feel, and believe in. As managers attempt to drive performance by changing the way employees behave, they all too often neglect the thoughts, feelings, and beliefs that, in turn, drive behavior. Consider a bank that through a benchmarking exercise discovered that its sales per banker were lagging behind those of the competition. After finding that bankers spent too little time with customers and too much time on paperwork, the bank set about reengineering the loan-origination process in order to maximize customer-facing time. Unfortunately, six months later, the levels of improvement were far lower than envisioned.

A further investigation, with an eye to the bankers' mind-sets rather than their behaviors, revealed that they simply found customer interactions uncomfortable and therefore preferred paperwork. This feeling was driven by a combination of introverted personalities, poor interpersonal skills, and a feeling of inferiority when dealing with customers who (by and large) have more money and education than the bankers do. Finally, most bankers were loath to think of themselves as salespeople--a notion they perceived as better suited to employees on used-car lots than in bank branches.

Armed with these root-cause insights, training for bankers was expanded to include elements related to personality types, emotional intelligence, and vocational identity (recasting ""sales"" as the more noble pursuit of ""helping customers discover and fulfill their unarticulated needs""). This enhancement not only put the program back on track within six months but also ultimately delivered sustainable sales lifts in excess of original targets.

9. Good intentions aren't enough. Good skill-building programs usually take into account that people learn better by doing than by listening. These programs are replete with interactive simulations and role plays, and commitments are made by participants regarding what they will ""practice"" back in the workplace. But come Monday morning, very few keep their commitments.

This lack of follow-through is usually not due to ill intent: it is because nothing formal has been done to lower the barriers to practicing new skills. The time and energy required to do something additional, or even to do something in a new way, simply don't exist in the busy day-to-day schedules of most employees. This failure to create the space for practice back in the workplace dooms most training programs to deliver returns that are far below their potential.

We advocate a number of enhancements to traditional training approaches in order to hardwire day-to-day practice into capability-building processes. First, training should not be a one-off event. Instead, a ""field and forum"" approach should be taken, in which classroom training is spread over a series of learning forums and fieldwork is assigned in between. Second, we suggest creating fieldwork assignments that link directly to the day jobs of participants, requiring them to put into practice new mind-sets and skills in ways that are hardwired into their responsibilities. These assignments should have quantifiable, outcome-based measures that indicate levels of competence gained and certification that recognizes and rewards the skills attained.

In the same way that the field of economics has been transformed by an understanding of uniquely human social, cognitive, and emotional biases, so too is the practice of change management in need of a transformation through an improved understanding of how humans interpret their environment and choose to act. While sustained impact can be measured only over numbers of years, our early results when applying these insights give us the confidence to broadly share our thinking.

At the end of the day, when you look at many of the companies right now, they're in exploration mode, which is correct, since this is new. They're throwing out some proofs of concept (POCs) to find the value, and what it will take to achieve. The big question revolves around the end intervention. What change will be needed in the organization to unlock the benefits? What do humans need to do differently to accept, adopt, and scale gen AI? I see more effort needed on that front in many organizations.

Similarly, on the technology side, one piece is about proving what the technology can do. And for those who really want to adopt and scale, another piece involves putting those foundations in place. Do you have the machine learning operations (MLOps) needed to productionize many, many, many models at scale? Do you have the data foundation necessary to really fuel the models and unlock the opportunities at that scale? I think those are the two conversations I would love to see taking place more across Europe.

"33","Personalizing change management in the smartphone era","Alexander DiLeonardo , David Mendelsohn , Nikil Selvam , Alexandra Wood","May 14, 2020","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/personalizing-change-management-in-the-smartphone-era","1","CEOs know that making organizational change stick requires convincing big groups of geographically dispersed people to think, act, and approach their work differently. And this is devilishly hard, as human beings are motivated by many things, have different fears and aspirations, feel varying levels of empowerment and commitment, and tend to be reluctant to change in the first place. Undifferentiated approaches that don't carefully consider employees' mindsets will fall flat and may even breed cynicism that saps morale and undermines progress.

The good news is that when it comes to personalization, senior executives have plenty of inspiration, courtesy of analytical pioneers such as Instagram, Netflix, and Spotify, all adept at tailoring products to meet individualized preferences via apps and other easy-to-use digital platforms. A large global manufacturer's ongoing experiment in tech-infused mass personalization shows how this thinking can be applied to organizational change. The company's experience suggests how smart combinations of digital technology, analytics, and behavioral science can make change more inclusive and persuasive--and help employees unleash their enthusiasm in ways not possible otherwise. The key is to use the available tools to better understand people and meet them where they are--a guiding principle that's equally relevant for implementing long-term change and for leading a remote workforce through the current disruptions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic.

For a few years, the manufacturer had tried with limited success to implement cultural changes across a key region's 7,000-strong workforce--for example, by promoting behaviors it hoped would break down silos, empower and motivate frontline workers, and bolster performance. Now the CEO wanted a fresh start. An assessment highlighted places where the company's organizational health was poor or needed strengthening. From these areas, senior leaders focused on three management practices: operational discipline, inspirational forms of leadership, and the use of rewards and recognition to better motivate employees.

The company then formed a team to translate these broad cultural goals into specific mindsets and behaviors that would both generate the desired organizational outcomes and also help employees better understand how they personally contributed to the improvement. For example, the manufacturer wanted employees to think of operational discipline as everyone's job. One tangible way to promote this would be to encourage shop-floor operators and supervisors to consciously review the company's ""golden rules of safety"" before every shift. Likewise, the company sought to instill a mindset of valuing continuous improvement and celebrating small victories. One way of doing this would be to encourage people to speak up immediately when they saw a colleague do something positive (a motivational take on the mantra ""if you see something, say something"").

The team now had a discrete set of behaviors they wanted to encourage. But they knew that to do so effectively, they needed to meet people where they were--they couldn't simply tell people to change. The team needed to address any mindsets or beliefs that could act as barriers. Lessons from organizational psychology and behavioral science helped identify a range of potential roadblocks, and an assessment survey of employees and subsequent analysis to spot patterns in the data helped the manufacturer isolate the most prevalent roadblocks to tackle. While the roadblocks themselves touched upon several factors (for example, employees' beliefs about whether a given behavior is part of their job or conflicts with their personal values) the roadblocks broadly fell into three types (exhibit): ""I'm not allowed,"" ""I can't,"" and ""I won't.""

Company leaders quickly saw how roadblocks could prevent employees from adopting beneficial behaviors. For example, the manufacturer had long encouraged supervisors to take ""gemba walks""--visits to the shop floor that help spot production issues and encourage useful conversations with frontline workers. Yet the analysis showed that many supervisors didn't prioritize the walks or make time for them, in part because they thought the culture didn't truly support them using their time this way and also because they worried they'd be bombarded during the walks by new problems they couldn't handle.

To address the roadblocks most effectively--and advance the transformation's broader goals--the team ran a pilot project involving 500 employees. The goal: serve up a rich mix of daily content (videos, text-based messages, and short quizzes) all designed to encourage employees to embrace the changes personally. The content was delivered via mobile-phone app in order to make the most of employees' existing preferences and habits; moreover, the app's content was tailored for both frontline operators and supervisors, as well as for different shop-floor locations inside the facility. Crucially, the app's algorithm paired the tips, reminders, and suggestions it delivered to employees with the roadblocks they reported experiencing. Periodic web-based quizzes provided data that showed the degree to which employees experienced the roadblocks, and gauged progress overcoming them. The result was, essentially, a customized development plan that supported a range of personalized interventions and that could be optimized in real time.

A supervisor we'll call Heloisa,1
for instance, reported having difficulty finding the time to give feedback to her team of operators. When she opened the app, she was prompted to watch a short video of her colleagues discussing how important they felt it was to receive feedback. Then, a few days later, Heloisa received a push notification explaining practical approaches for delivering quick, effective feedback. Meanwhile, a frontline operator we'll call Juan was resisting giving feedback because he felt that doing so would hurt his relationship with his coworkers. When he accessed the platform, among the content bits he received were messages to help him realize the importance of constructive feedback in establishing a safe and efficient workplace.

In addition to clearing roadblocks, the platform helps employees reach the program's broader cultural goals. A supervisor we'll call Ana, for instance, wasn't recognizing the small, daily victories of her colleagues, largely because she didn't feel she had the skills to do so. When she engaged with the platform, she received bite-size exercises and coaching to help build this capability. Six weeks into the change program, Ana reported a significant shift in how frequently she recognized others--a testament to the skills she developed through the coaching and an improvement directly linked to a management practice (""rewards and recognition"") that the company was prioritizing.

The team manages the app in conjunction with the same centralized ""transformation office"" that leads the broader change effort. This gives senior executives an integrated view of where things are progressing or lagging. Dashboards show where participation rates on a module are down, or where employees aren't retaining certain information, allowing the company to make adjustments in real time.

During the launch of the pilot, for example, the data suggested that some employees weren't answering questions candidly; they were simply choosing the most optimistic-sounding responses to survey questions. The team updated the algorithm so that if users appeared to be answering questions in a pattern, a pop-up message reminded them that their responses were always anonymous and unlinked to the company's HR systems (a vital message, and one that was communicated continually and in other forms). Responses to the roadblock assessment quickly became more realistic, which both confirmed the challenge ahead and gave the team confidence that employees increasingly trusted the effort and took it seriously.

Adding communal aspects to the app--the ability to post user-generated images, videos, and messages within the content feed, as well as sharing, tagging, and ""like"" functionality--encouraged more employees to interact with the platform and helped spur enthusiasm for the pilot. And, as more employees shared their stories, posted photos, and called out good behavior, it also reinforced the program's goals (after all, people are more likely to follow through on behavior change when they commit to it publicly). Simple gamification, including the addition of ""badges"" for social posts, helped too. Indeed, as word of the platform spread and people became curious, employees who weren't part of the pilot wanted in, and what was meant to be a test for 500 employees quickly expanded to allow all 7,000 employees to participate.

The results of the three-month pilot have been encouraging, and the company is now rolling out the effort more broadly. Overall attainment scores suggest an average individual improvement of 10 percent against the three management practices the company is prioritizing. Improvements in some areas were rapid--with scores rising about 5 percent every two weeks over the span of the pilot. Meanwhile, the manufacturing unit involved in the effort enjoyed a 6 percent increase in production, an encouraging result that company leaders attribute to a combination of the pilot along with a focused effort to reinforce lean-management principles.

Importantly, employees inside the manufacturing unit report that the work feels different, as momentum for the program grows. Night-shift workers have demonstrated particular enthusiasm. Whereas before, change efforts might have seemed mystifying or incomplete to them--motivational posters appearing in the workspace overnight, companywide mass communications from leaders they rarely saw--now the goals of the program made sense. The platform has also improved their level of recognition in the company and their connectedness to the day shift, which is helping break down the silo mentality that worked against the company's operational and safety goals.

Change is hard, and change is intensely personal. When we know what's expected of us, see how our unique efforts contribute to the whole, and are encouraged to treat change as a personal journey, we are more likely to be energized by the prospect of change than fearful of it. As the manufacturer's experience suggests, smart combinations of technology, analytics, and behavioral science can help catalyze change at scale in ways that aren't possible otherwise.

"34","All I ever needed to know about change management I learned at engineering school","Roger Dickhout","May 1, 1997","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/all-i-ever-needed-to-know-about-change-management-i-learned-at-engineering-school","1","I have always been fascinated by how things work. As a child, I would follow my father around the yard, helping him with various projects. How, I wondered, did the load in the wheelbarrow always balance? Why could I move a big rock with a crowbar, but not without? How does cement dry underwater?

It is hardly surprising that when I came of age, I followed in my father's footsteps once more, this time to engineering school. Here I learned the precise formulae that govern the forces of nature. Boring to some, for me these axioms held a special magic, because understanding them conferred great power--the power to harness the forces of nature for the works of man.

I have strayed from my professional roots. Over the past decade at McKinsey, I have helped clients design and execute major change programs, and led research projects on frontline change, operational improvement, and company-wide transformation. I have borrowed many good ideas from the literature on personal and organizational change. Often, however, it has left me wondering how change really works.

I am a mechanical engineer. We mechanical engineers tease our civil engineering colleagues that they only have to figure out how to make things stand up or fall down. Mechanical engineers have to figure out how to make things go round and round--a skill of a higher order. Making change always seemed to me like mechanical engineering, but a lot of the literature reads as if it were written by civil engineers.

You can read books on the four, five, or six things you have to do to make a great company stand rather than fall, as though the corporation were a civil structure that you could make stand up, and leave it at that. These static, normative models are admittedly helpful, presenting as they do a vision of what ""good"" looks like, and identifying some of the changes that can bring it about. But they do not really capture the dynamic characteristics of change. They will not bring to life what happens when a dynamic system gets out of balance, when momentum falters, when the best-laid plans yield unexpected results. They won't explain, in other words, how you get change to go round and round.

My colleagues and others tell me that business leaders like the static, normative way of thinking. This article, then, may not be for everyone. But there may be a few other poor souls who, like me, got hooked early on understanding the basic laws that govern action. So I decided to write down the five basic premises I consider as I help clients design their change programs--ideas I think of as natural laws of organizational change.

These laws are inspired by the power of scientific thinking. Unlike scientific laws, however, they have not been conclusively proven through controlled experiments. They represent a personal perspective developed through reading and research, as well as through trial and observation in the daily routine of client service. They are: the law of constituent balance, the law of leverage, the law of momentum, the law of feedback and adjustment, and the law of leadership.

The need for major change is often driven by an imbalance between a company's constituent stakeholders: shareholders, employees, customers, communities, and management. This basic law answers the question ""Why change?""

Nature consists of ecosystems in balance--structures in which different species live interdependently. When an ecosystem is knocked out of balance for whatever reason, a period of often violent flux follows, during which scarce resources are dynamically redistributed and the system arrives at a new balance that better reflects the new environment. Similarly, when constituent interests are out of balance in a large corporation, a power struggle erupts. The gloves come off as shareholder groups rebel against complacent management, or customers punish a company for poor quality. The mentality of scarcity is at play.

Where possible, this imbalance should be exploited to create the conditions for change. However, if a winning formula, once found, is to be sustained, the system must eventually be brought back into balance. High performance can be maintained only when a mentality of surplus has been restored: when customers are satisfied, talent and investment flow in, and management, employees, and shareholders feel adequately rewarded. The evolution of constituent balance during the change provides clues as to which forces can be harnessed at different times to drive the change forward.

Early capitalist models emphasized the claims of owners and customers. More recently, democratic pluralist societies have substituted shareholders for owners and added employees and communities to create the four-stakeholder model that many modern corporations have in their credo. What always gets left out of the model, but should not be forgotten, is that a fifth group, management, weighs heavily in the balance of power. What value has an analysis of Iraq that does not consider Saddam Hussein?

Maximize the return on effort by changing the things that will produce the greatest results. This law helps me understand what to change.

Archimedes deduced over 2,000 years ago that force could be multiplied by applying it to a lever at a particular distance from a fulcrum. ""Give me a lever,"" he said, ""and I will move the world."" Finding the right levers--and pushing them hard enough--is as critical in change management as it is in mechanics.

My experience has been that our instinct is to make more changes than are necessary, without applying enough insight into which changes really matter. Too often, we are simply anxious to make something happen. How can we identify the important changes, and resist acting on secondary problems?

Much of the literature on change implies that a high-performing company needs to do everything remarkably well--and, in recommending across-the-board reengineering, seems to take for granted that low-performing companies must be doing everything badly. In fact, high-performing companies do many things imperfectly; they just do the important things--or enough of the important things--well. Meanwhile, underperforming companies often do many important things fairly well, but not with enough intensity.

Indeed, once analysis has confirmed which levers should be pulled, extraordinary tenacity will be required to pull them hard enough to drive changes uncompromisingly over the 60 percent threshold. Doing something 60 percent of the way is often enough; doing something 40 percent of the way, on the other hand, is often no better than doing nothing at all. That 20 percent swing makes all the difference. All of this means you have to examine a company very broadly before determining what really needs changing, and what merely needs intensifying. Your eventual path of action will be narrow, but to exploit the law of leverage you must begin with a wide field of vision.

Unfortunately, most of us start out blind in at least one eye. As an engineer, I found isolating the economic drivers of performance straightforward, but it was not until I worked alongside a firm specializing in cultural change that I came to understand the power of changing people's beliefs. Some CEOs have acute antennae for cultural symptoms; others see only business results. You need to learn to see in a number of dimensions, and to integrate what you see into a coherent picture.

Tools can help, but few tools offer a complete paradigm. Recently, I have found that looking carefully at three types of levers has sharpened my vision. First, take aim at the direct economic levers: driving down costs and increasing revenues. Then, understand how levers that focus the organization--structures, processes, targets--affect performance indirectly. Finally, examine the performance context: levers such as vision, values, and power base.1

Acting on a path narrower than your field of vision calls for self-control and detachment--a detachment that must paradoxically be combined with an intense performance orientation and an impatience for results. As we have seen, you can do a lot of things fairly well and still not achieve the performance you aspire to; fortunately, you can also do a lot of things wrong as long as you get the important things right and drive hard enough on these to make the difference. Seek the fewest changes for the greatest result.

Liberate the energy to drive the change.

""We have to get this place in gear."" ""The challenge now is to keep moving forward."" ""We are running out of steam. How do we get restarted?"" Experienced change leaders struggle with these basic problems. Change is work. Work requires energy. Where is the energy to come from?

The first law of thermodynamics states that energy can be neither created nor destroyed. Consequently, the energy required to change a system from one state to another must come either from within a closed system as energy changes its form (from light to heat, say, or pressure to temperature), or from beyond the boundaries of the closed system.

So too with major change. Energy can be introduced from outside--as with pressure from shareholders or new management--or the system's own potential energy can be transformed into kinetic energy. Potential energy is released by raising the aspirations and shaping the beliefs of pivotal members of the organization, and by liberating available capacity and capability to work on the change.

As with mechanical engineering, the horsepower of the engine must be matched to the task, or the task scaled to the horsepower of the engine. Consequently, the law of leverage, which focuses energy on the key changes, is especially critical during takeoff, when energy may be scarce.

Energy limits can also be managed by offsetting endothermic, energy-consuming change initiatives with exothermic, energy-liberating ones. A frontline focus on customer satisfaction, directly exposing a company to the demands of its customers, will unleash a massive surge of energy across the whole organization. On the other hand, cost reduction, while it may be a critical ingredient of a change program, often consumes energy by arousing fear at the same time as it removes capacity. Focusing sharply and quickly on cost opportunities and avoiding enervating rounds of organizational downsizing can minimize the energy required, but the sort of spontaneous combustion that can be generated by customer satisfaction efforts is unlikely to materialize.

Similar to the exothermic/endothermic balance is the balance between push and pull that a skilled change agent will exploit to get change going. Major change will inevitably call for new behaviors. The change agent instinctively gives the system a push by building new tools to enable these behaviors. Simultaneously, he or she must create a pull, or demand for these tools, by putting in place new targets and measures that will focus the organization on the desired behaviors, in turn causing it to reach for these tools.

If it is to drive continuing change, a change effort must build sources of energy as well as producing results. Accomplishing a transformation from low to high performance can take several episodes over a number of years. To power these episodes, a company must discover a pattern of change that builds momentum within an episode and that promotes the shared vision, confidence, leadership capacity, and capabilities that will make the next episode possible.

The particular strategy will vary with the situation. Eliminating a layer of change-resistant management and reorganizing into segment-focused business units can liberate the energy needed to engage new management in the task of improving performance. When this kind of approach reaches its limitations, however, new blood may be required before the next episode can be launched. But the general law remains: you must achieve results and build energy for more change. If you do not go forward, you will slip back.

Learn how your organization responds to change, and adjust the program accordingly.

The laws of leverage and momentum offer insight into harnessing the underlying physics of your business system. But there are limits to the predictability of change. Acting on the bottlenecks to improvement will create new bottlenecks. Moreover, the forces driving the change will ebb and flow. Competitors may become stronger, raising customers' expectations and redefining performance levels; shareholders may win more control; management may gain or lose courage. Change may itself create opportunity.

In mechanical engineering, control theory dictates that a closed-loop control system is required to monitor a transformation process when response characteristics are sensitive to environmental conditions. In a closed-loop system, transducers measure the input and output of the system and compare the actual output to the expected output. Then the input can be iteratively adjusted until the desired result is achieved.

In the same way, however complete the field of vision in a major change situation, or however sophisticated the strategies to generate momentum, some changes are bound to work out less well than others. In change efforts, leadership actions combine with the communication of the aspiration for change and its specific objectives to create an ""input."" Project structures, targets, and milestones provide a framework for measuring actual against expected ""output"" so that leadership actions can be modified accordingly. Thus early actions, while producing results and increasing energy, also serve as a dynamic diagnostic. You will learn at least as much by watching your organization's response to change as by analyzing its current state.

Change leaders also establish other, less formal networks and processes to gauge progress and reset priorities for action. These make it possible to identify when an organization is running out of steam, or, conversely, when it has the confidence to take on a bigger challenge. Being dynamically responsive to change as it progresses also allows you to take advantage of timing. An obvious need to restructure work practices, for example, may be impossible to address in a tight market with an entrenched union leadership. If prices fall and union leadership changes, however, an opportunity may arise to broaden the change program in mid-stream.

Leadership is the catalyst of change.

In chemistry, small amounts of catalyst intensify and accelerate reactions in much larger masses. Indeed, in many chemical reactions, all the ingredients may be in place, but if the catalyst is absent, nothing will happen. Similarly, the four basic mechanisms of change--exploiting the imbalance between constituents, focusing on the high-leverage opportunities, generating momentum by liberating energy, feeding back and adjusting--are always intensified and accelerated by the personal example of a change leader. Without it, the change may be stillborn. Ultimately, leadership is the scarce resource.

The aspirations and preferences of the primary protagonist have a big impact on the way change unfolds. Notwithstanding the need for a broad field of vision, leaders do come with approaches they are most comfortable with. There is no such thing as a perfect leader. If change is to have credibility within an organization, it must be congruent with the actions of its leader.

Establish a small team at the top--think two to three, not one, not ten--to initiate and guide the change. These people must be role models for leaders down the line. Propel the vision, engaging the down-the-line leaders in the process of change through targets and objectives. Align coalitions: satisfy mutual interests where possible, but don't be afraid to use your power if you have to (change, like everything else, has a dark side). Set expectations very high; the organization may not know what excellent performance looks like. Create new symbols by celebrating success and destroying vestiges of the old culture. These are the critical catalyzing activities in the process of change.

Well, for me, that's how things work. There are obviously many specifics that need to be considered in any change process--industry dynamics, functional knowledge, the characteristics of the organization in question--and particular strategies must be devised to exploit them. But I find that no matter whether it is a resource or a consumer business, an Indian or a Canadian company, a total organizational change or a plant turnaround, these basic laws seem to hold. It's easy to get lost in the nuts and bolts of performance imperatives, personalities, and processes. By stepping back to first principles, you can rise above minutiae to identify the crucial actions it will take to transform your company.

"35","Five principles to manage change in the military","David Chinn , John Dowdy","December 1, 2014","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/five-principles-to-manage-change-in-the-military","1","Defense spending has been under pressure for some time now in the developed world. After climbing dramatically for the better part of a decade in the aftermath of September 11, 2001, defense spending began to fall in many countries after the global financial crisis of 2008. European members of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization were the first to make cuts, with total spending falling by $37 billion from the high-water mark in 2008 through 2012, and a further $4 billion in cuts between 2012 and 2015 is expected. Even the United States, where spending continued to rise until 2011, plans to reduce spending by about $65 billion between 2012 and 2015. The pressure of trying to squeeze more military capability from declining defense dollars has been with us for a number of years and seems likely to continue.

It's not that hard for reasonable people to agree on a set of steps that militaries must take to cope with the tremendous pressures they face today. In the United States, for example, in June 2013, a bipartisan group of defense analysts agreed on an agenda of changes for the US Department of Defense. In Europe, many militaries have long agreed in principle to the pooling and sharing of equipment.

However, acting on the agenda is much harder, especially in today's complex environment. The initiatives that militaries are contemplating--intensive, programmatic, cross-discipline, and often cross-service changes to fundamental processes such as procurement, logistics, and maintenance--are not minor adjustments. The changes these initiatives entail are transformational, not incremental, and require major shifts in mind-sets, behaviors, and capabilities.

Successfully implementing this type of transformational change is not easy; indeed, the majority of transformation programs in both the public and private sector fail. Our recent survey of almost 1,000 leaders and senior employees in more than 30 US government agencies found that only 40 percent believed that their transformation programs succeeded.

However, our experience with large-scale transformation programs in defense organizations around the world has taught us five lessons that can help contribute to the success of a defense transformation.

Start at the sharp end. Defense leaders are concerned first and foremost with preparing, deploying, and sustaining forces to deliver operational effect. Change programs in defense that start with operational effectiveness create stronger engagement and are more likely to succeed than those focused primarily on cost reduction. The United Kingdom's work on end-to-end logistics serves as a good example. Rather than focusing primarily on cost reduction, the program set out to deliver a number of important operational improvements. These included reducing the deployed footprint, improving supply-chain performance, and increasing platform availability. By proposing to deliver a superior operational solution, the program secured the full support of operational commanders.

As a result of this work, delivery time to bases in the United Kingdom and Germany decreased from 30 days to 7 days, among other effects. In Afghanistan, customer wait time was reduced by 15 days. In almost all of the areas investigated, the program also delivered a more cost-effective solution. This served to prove that a better solution is usually also a cheaper one, though the converse is not always true. In its annual report and accounts for 2003-04, the UK Ministry of Defence reported that the end-to-end logistics review both improved logistics effectiveness and generated savings for investment in other priorities.

Similarly, in its restructuring as part of the Danish Defence Agreement (Forsvarsforlig) 2005-09, the Danish Defence set out to move from a static, defensive posture to one that could better support expeditionary missions abroad. The Danish Ministry of Defence described the situation and the work it did: ""The support structures, the tail, had grown out of proportion, and the operational structures, the teeth, had reached a level of close to irrelevance. The restructuring from scratch entails a change in emphasis in order to bring the priorities from 40 percent operational capabilities and 60 percent support structures to 60 percent operational capabilities and 40 percent support structure.""1
In the process of designing a more deployable force, the Danish military reduced support costs by a third.

Lead through the line. In a typical transformation program, a project team--often working in relative isolation--defines the program's objectives, designs initiatives, and expects personnel on the ground to implement them. This is a mistake, particularly in military organizations where, in our experience, commanders often prefer to give up budget rather than authority. In contrast, leaders of successful defense transformations empower line personnel, set clear expectations of them, and hold them accountable for the transformation's success within the established chain of command. The UK's Defence Logistics Transformation Programme was particularly successful in this regard. Warfighters were embedded into each of the project teams and helped shape the specific recommendations. Suggested changes were then vetted with the appropriate frontline commanders, who were able to quiz their own embedded staff about the suitability of the resulting initiatives. An audit of the program by the UK Office of Government Commerce found ""the programme appears to have been notably successful, through a structure of programme boards, in obtaining buy-in at senior levels in the frontline commands whose full involvement in implementing the change will be vital to success.""2
Leading change programs ""through the line"" in this way capitalizes on the can-do attitude of military culture, empowering officers to hit aggressive targets set through the chain of command.

Resist the urge to reorganize; start with quick wins. When embarking on a transformation program, it can be tempting to focus first on reorganization. But an initial emphasis on roles, responsibilities, and reporting often delivers few results. Leaders of successful defense transformations resist the urge to reorganize; they focus first on securing successes that can make a big difference to the momentum of a program. They specifically aim to achieve quick wins, often through targeted pilots, over the first three to six months. Many of these initial successes can then be turned into transformational change across the organization.

In one example from 2009, a defense ministry conducted a diagnostic to assess the quality of procurement processes, organization structures, and outputs in its defense establishment. The diagnostic also assessed the value received for expenditures and the scale of the opportunity for achieving efficiencies. Detailed analyses of six categories covering approximately one-third of nonequipment purchasing identified the potential for annual savings as 8 to 10 percent. The diagnostic homed in on three root causes of inefficiencies. First, the defense establishment lacked a single point of accountability for each category. No function or individual in the organization had visibility into the cost implications of decisions made at each step of the process. Second, the absence of performance metrics resulted in an insufficient focus on cost efficiency. Third, a series of organizational, process, and budgetary barriers impeded efforts to capture scale benefits. The ministry piloted several initiatives to address these inefficiencies in four nonequipment categories. For each category, it created an integrated category-management team. Based on the success of this effort, it then conducted a major overhaul of the budgeting process and redesigned the purchasing organization by appointing a ""lead purchaser"" to manage each generic category. By running the pilots first, it was able to point to its success to overcome resistance within the organization.

Expect (and plan to overcome) resistance to change. B. H. Liddell Hart probably said it best: ""The only thing harder than getting a new idea into the military mind is to get an old one out.""3
Many military leaders would agree that their organizations are highly resistant to change as a result of their size, complexity, and culture. Yet despite a general awareness of this challenge, even seasoned defense leaders underestimate the degree of inertia and resistance to change within their organization. Leaders of successful defense transformations take an end-to-end approach to overcome this inertia in two ways. First, they set a clear vision and ambition for the transformation--one that emphasizes the link to the organization's overall mission, clarifies why the program is necessary, and outlines a journey over the coming years that resonates within the organization. When the Danish Defence restructured to adjust to a more expeditionary posture, it set an ambitious goal to reduce support costs by a third while maintaining output, a target reached as promised within four years. The savings were required to fund a series of important increases in deployable forces, which served to secure support from operational commanders. Second, leaders of successful transformations provide credible and visible commitment to the transformation from top-level leadership. The United Kingdom's end-to-end review of air and land logistics, for example, was jointly led by the vice chief of the defense staff and the Ministry of Defence's second permanent undersecretary.

Invest in building capabilities. Building the right capabilities is a prerequisite to achieving and sustaining change in any organization. Among US government leaders who reported limited success in their change efforts, 75 percent said that the right capabilities were not present. In many defense ministries, leaders rise through the ranks based on a substantial body of excellent work that demonstrates mastery of core military and leadership skills critical to warfighting. But achieving and sustaining change often requires not military but management capabilities in fields such as project management, procurement, and product development. Successful transformation programs first define the core and functional capabilities required and then invest in building these capabilities using programs that follow best-practice adult-learning principles. Such approaches, which are familiar to the military from its combat-skill development, can be six to seven times more effective than conventional training courses. Take project management, for example, where a robust organizational capability can pare as much as 20 percent of costs in about half the defense budget. One defense organization used ""learning by doing"" programs to train several waves of project managers and leaders. Managers who successfully completed the training designed to build their project-management capabilities were able to cut costs on most projects by between 20 and 35 percent.

These five guidelines are the distilled wisdom of hundreds of military and civilian leaders with whom we've been privileged to work. We do not say that this is the sum of all the knowledge on the topic. But we do believe that a transformation that follows these five guidelines stands a higher chance of success.

November 6, 2024Every year, the global payments ecosystem descends on Las Vegas for the Money 20/20 conference, bringing together banks, pure payments players, tech firms, and fintechs, among others. It's a great opportunity to take the pulse of the industry, and at this year's conference, which took place at the end of October, we saw and heard about the big themes that are top of mind for many of the participants. Our five main takeaways:

The past couple of years have been a turbulent and challenging environment for many in the payments industry, especially fintechs, as investors pulled back. Overall funding for fintechs peaked in 2021 at $92.3 billion, capping a period of hypergrowth, only to fall back sharply in 2022 and 2023 to $55.1 billion and $30 billion respectively, on the backs of rising interest rates and deteriorating macroeconomic conditions, along with geopolitical shocks and concerns about an overheated market. While funding from both venture capital and private equity is still below those levels at $23.7 billion annualized, valuations have bounced back for many fintech subsectors. That rebound was palpable in Las Vegas. Whereas a year ago we saw hesitancy and nervousness about the longer-term health of the sector, this year the mood at the conference was much more bullish. Of course, some will face difficult choices, including those who raised money at valuations during the boom that are harder to justify based on current unit economics, increased competition, and slowing growth. But increasingly, we sense a return to cautious excitement and more positive investor interest that is likely to play out in coming months.

For payments providers, cross-border transactions have long been the new frontier, but a challenging one to cross, one that requires the infrastructure but also the know-how to manage risk and regulatory stipulations including local KYC rules. While the United States has a very advanced national payments market, cross-border payments remains an area rife with painful customer experiences and a lot of fragmented options with a wide range of costs. In Las Vegas this year, we heard a lot of new talk about cross-border and how to make it a better experience--and picked up considerable energy around tech and business model innovation to make that happen. Some fintechs and non-bank players are putting in place new infrastructure to help them scale, but we also heard from more traditional banks that they, too, are thinking about cross-border payments and starting to fight back.

AI and its newest offspring, generative AI (gen AI), was a big topic in Las Vegas. No surprise there: is there any industry conference anywhere at which the subject doesn't loom large these days? AI has actually been a perennial topic for some time in the payments space, particularly for non-customer-facing aspects such as transaction security and identity fraud. Gen AI is helping to catalyze a refocusing on the potential uses that can help create value, including smarter analysis of spending patterns that can inform personalized offerings, shopping, and rewards programs. For now, the use cases we are mainly hearing about are internal processes that players are experimenting with, such as those around customer service, sales productivity, and report generation. And the operative word here is ""experiment""-- a lot of things are being tried and, while there is an overwhelming sense of opportunity, there's less clarity about what will stick.

When the funding boom was in full swing, much of the buzz was about start-ups and disruption. Now we are seeing traditional banks and infrastructure providers putting a focus on innovation. Some of the innovations they are eyeing are not actually that new, for example buy now, pay later (BNPL) offerings or leveraging AI for fraud prevention. But that's the point: what may have been too new and too risky for cautious incumbents five years ago has stood the test of time and is therefore of increasing interest. Among the topics we heard incumbents discussing was stablecoin, a type of cryptocurrency whose value is pegged to another asset. In the go-go years of Web3 hype, traditional banks steered clear. Now they are discussing it.

Finally, we heard quite some talk about open banking, still a nascent area in the United States, but one that is starting to get attention. The timing was right, as the Consumer Finance Protection Bureau has just finalized a rule to implement Dodd-Frank Act Section 1033, which establishes a regulatory framework governing open banking in the United States. Once implemented, it will set new regulatory requirements on both depository and non-depository institutions, as well as tighten security around data sharing. Under Section 1033, consumers will gain access to their personal information held by their financial services provider.

Open banking has gained traction in some other countries, notably the United Kingdom. Essentially it allows financial data to be shared among an expanding universe of players who can offer new products and services. For customers, it provides greater flexibility in how their money is managed. In the United States, some players have made progress on pay--by bank payments, although this has not to date garnered strong consumer adoption. But discussions on the risk and regulatory environment for building this out are taking place and were visibly present in Las Vegas.

In short, this year's Money 20/20 was an invigorating few days, with plenty of evidence that the mood is changing and innovation with an eye on value creation is again very much in the forefront.

"37","Organizing for change","Kirk Rieckhoff","December 3, 2021","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/public-sector/our-insights/organizing-for-change","6","Why is change so hard? What can leaders do to plan effectively and engage team members in the change process? In this episode of the McKinsey on Government podcast, McKinsey senior partner Kirk Rieckhoff talks about how to get people on board and achieve meaningful goals.

Francis Rose: Welcome to McKinsey on Government. Each episode examines one of the hardest problems facing government today and offers solutions from McKinsey experts and other leaders. I'm the host of McKinsey on Government, Francis Rose.

The last year and a half has certainly been a time of change in the federal government. And the next 18 months will include even more. Organizing for change is the subject of McKinsey on Government this week with McKinsey senior partner Kirk Rieckhoff.

Kirk, thanks for joining me today. I appreciate your time. Just about every federal government leader that I've talked to in the past 15 years at some point in time brings up the subject of change management as a difficult concept for them to deal with, along with whatever they have in front of them.

Why is change so hard? And maybe by explaining why change is so hard you can give me the concept behind this idea of organizing for change. Setting oneself up for success is kind of the thought that I take behind that concept, Kirk. Welcome.

Kirk Rieckhoff: Well, thanks. It's really great to be here. And I appreciate the time, Francis. You know, when I hear the question today, ""Why is change so hard?,"" I would almost turn it on its head and say, ""Well, it shouldn't be easy."" Because at some level, if you think of organizations, which are really what we're talking about, these are systems with people in them.

The system is operating in the way that is its status quo. Imagine a ball between two hills. It rolls and stays in the middle. Now a leader can sit there and try to push it up the hill and hold it there. But once the leader gets distracted and moves away, it's going to go right back to where the natural equilibrium is. And that's where you're encountering an organization, typically. It's in its natural equilibrium state, unless it's in some sort of big external chain. In a way, it's set up to not change. So you've got to ask yourself, ""All right, what do I do to shift that equilibrium point, to shift the ball over?"" That's where we have to start the discussion.

I think the second thing is--if that's the conceptual version of a system's thinking--what I love is the fact that it's a system that has individuals with free will in the middle of it all. If you're an engineer, when you're building a bridge, you think about the properties, the material that is part of that bridge. In any system, that's true. And this is a system of people. So the question is actually, ""What matters to the people in this system?"" and working within that, not against it.

Francis Rose: As you're describing the idea of the leader pushing the rock up the hill, it strikes me that what makes that leader's job easier is bringing a bunch of people around him or her to help push the rock up the hill. What have you seen as successful ways that leaders can bring people in, engage them in the change itself, and help them understand that, yes, this isn't going to be easy, but there's some better outcome on the other side, which is the reason that we're doing this, instead of just change for change's sake?

Kirk Rieckhoff: It's a great question. I'll break that answer into three things. To continue the analogy, to have the boulder going up the hill, having more people help you push that boulder makes it easier.

Look, you can't dig out and move the whole hill. But you could dig out a section of the hill, and all of a sudden, the boulder falls in there and is at least stable. Because that's what you're looking to do as the second thing.

So get a bunch of people around you who could help you do it. Think about, ""What can I change that makes this the new normal way, even if it could slide back?"" But you know what? If I were to leave and get distracted, it's most likely going to stay where it is. And it'll be OK there.

Francis Rose: What does a leader do that's successful in engaging his team so that the leader is not the only person pushing the boulder? Maybe the analogy makes more sense given the context you just added, that the boulder is just on a piece of flat ground.

It gets to a certain distance, and if the leader disengages, it just kind of sits there. Maybe it doesn't roll all the way back down the hill, and you go back to nothing. Rather, it just doesn't continue. Whichever analogy you use, engaging people around that leader is really critical to success, regardless of what someone's trying to accomplish.

Kirk Rieckhoff: I'd like to put it in a couple of different ways. I think the first one is the team around you is the most important factor to your success. It is that team and getting them on board with you, really believing in the change that you're doing, that's going to make the difference, because you're only one person. But you can amplify this aspiration if you have ten other people on board with you.

The question is, how do you do that? How do you get the people on board? This idea that you're controlling them or telling them what to do is ludicrous. No senior leader is interested in someone else directing them on what to do. They became a senior leader because they like to make things happen. In that kind of a context, it is about, I think, the leader first setting that aspiration and then convincing others that this is the right place to be.

And that means appealing to them across the five sources of meaning that we all have. We've each got our own single one, whether it's appealing to the mission, appealing to yourself or your need for self-improvement, appealing to the customers that you're serving or the organization that you're a part of, these are the deep ""whys"" that really get people going. We've all got one of those. So I would appeal to that and ideally make sense across all of them.

I think the second part, though, is painting this aspiration as great. But then you also have to equally describe what reality is today and get common agreement there. The gap between those two things is what powers you and powers the team: we know where we are, and we know where we're headed. We don't know how we're going to get there, quite frankly, but we at least know those two things. And then we're going to work ourselves through it.

Francis Rose: Once you have the people on board, the good leader, I imagine, has a plan, has tactical considerations to move that rock, whether it's uphill or on a flat piece of ground, to continue that analogy. What are the most successful mechanics for change? And how granular should a leader be when he or she is deciding what that plan will look like, Kirk?

Kirk Rieckhoff: I think a good leader has a plan. I think a great leader is somebody who has the rough outlines of where we're going and lets everyone figure it out from there.

The second-favorite technique, other than saying no and resisting change, is to say yes and then not do anything. Not doing anything is like staying in the planning mode the whole time, which will just get blown up once you start doing it anyway. I think having a high-level view of what the basic blocks are going to be--what are the milestones that we're looking at?--and the main lines of effort--who's responsible for making what happen?--and then listening is going to make stuff go, make stuff happen.

The key to success for making change happen is to start the change, versus just planning to. Step zero doesn't get you anywhere. You've got to go to step one, two, three. I would just add on to that, the idea of what I call ""the illusions of quick wins.""

Look, I love quick wins. But oftentimes, most organizations will have accomplished those already. Instead of looking for quick wins that people are going to try and erode anyway, what you're really looking for is quick progress.

It doesn't mean a thing was fully developed and you say, ""Look at this new thing we've done."" It is, rather, showing people who have been in this system, oftentimes where they've been trying to make change happen, that change is possible.

It might even be you just making really clear decisions on the first few instances of, here's what we're going to do: making ones like moving of resources, appointing new people to roles, or asking other people to leave roles. It's those kinds of things where people begin saying, ""You know what? Their actions are following their words, so I'm going to follow and do it as well.""

Francis Rose: So the connection, too, between the first and second points, between the idea of getting people on board and what the mechanics of change look like, is that if a leader has the confidence and courage--I think those are the best words to describe it--to let the plan kind of fill itself out as time goes on, those people are going to be engaged enough and have skin in the game. And they're going to want to sign on for the effort that it takes to make the change successful on a much higher level. Is that a fair read?

Kirk Rieckhoff: I think so. Absolutely.

Francis Rose: Where are the potential problems, the pitfalls? What are the issues that, time after time after time, people who try to make big change, people who try to push big rocks, run into that they shouldn't need to?

Kirk Rieckhoff: Well, certainly there are a lot. This is the fun of the game, right? This is why I love doing what we do, because you keep encountering new ones and they're always going to present differently, which is great. But to answer your question, maybe I'll name some of the three most common ones that I see.

The first one is around the ""frozen middle"" that we commonly hear people talk about, where the typical story goes something like: the leader has a vision and has enacted a new policy, but they can't get it through to the front lines. And they blame the frozen middle for being resistant.

I think they're looking at it in completely the wrong way. The people in the middle have the most expertise because they can see the front lines, right? They're close enough that they're seeing what really has to happen.

They can also see to the top of the organization, or the pressures that are coming down. They're right in between those two things. And if nothing's happening, it's probably because those people are quite smart and understand that this doesn't work.

The real question, then, is, well, why isn't it working? And let's change what we're doing. If the policy isn't working, there's a reason for it. Engage that middle management. Figure out how to make it work for them. We can spend a lot of our time trying to get the senior leaders on board, when actually what you want to do is just make it make sense for the middle management to be able to go after.

For example, the classic version that I see is where the top level will come up with a policy and maybe even the resources in terms of money. But then the authorities that it actually takes to execute are fragmented. You ask the middle management to do it. But in order for middle management to do something--I see this with testing and evaluation all the time--you have to go to their separate chain of command and then go all the way up. That whole thing just bogs it down.

Getting things done isn't easy. The middle management is stuck. Even if they didn't want to be frozen, they are. So I think you've got to shift the perspective and assume the middle management is going to be where all the action happens, and bring them in as you're building out how we can actually get this thing done.

Francis Rose: So what is the secret to bringing those people in? Because as you describe them--I mean, that's exactly what I scribbled down here--""engaging those people is critical to success."" How do great leaders, though, really hear those people and incorporate what those people know into the strategy or the tactics of driving change?

Kirk Rieckhoff: The first thing is that you have a choice to make. Do you want to engage them on, ""Is this a good idea or not?"" Or do you want to engage them on, ""How do we get this thing done?"" You can do one or the other or both. Frankly, I have found that most of the middle management is comfortable with leadership's collective wisdom.

They see a lot of things the middleman doesn't necessarily see. They get the fact that policies are going to be made, and so are missions. NASA, as an example, decides whether you're going to go to the moon or to an asteroid. OK, fine, that's going to happen.

The real question comes down below that: ""How do I get that done?"" I would engage them not on the ""what"" needs to get done, but on the ""how"" to get it done. We need to be honest with each other. Are you the kind of leader who wants to engage in the ""what""? That's a lot of the policy side. Or are you going to engage in the ""how,"" which is really making change happen?

Change is about the ""how,"" not the ""what."" I would encourage you to think through engaging with them on the ""how"" to make this happen, hearing their concerns about what's going to hold them back, what needs to be true.

The second thing is there will be people who love it, and they want to make it happen. There will be a group of people who say, ""Absolutely no way."" Then there's the middle part who are on the fence. I wouldn't worry about either of the two extremes. Just focus on the middle-middle part, which is to say, ""Hey, what do you all who are on the fence actually need to make this thing work? And how do we show it's happening?""

Francis Rose: The piece that I pull out of what you just said there, Kirk, is the leaders of organizations are there to be the ones that decide ""what."" And it strikes me that it's almost counterproductive for them to be engaging that frozen middle, if we want to call it that, on the ""what."" It strikes me as incredibly logical that the leadership decides the ""what"" and then brings in the frontline people, the practitioners, on an ongoing basis to do the ""how."" It seems to make too much sense, almost. Am I missing something?

Kirk Rieckhoff: It does make complete sense the way you framed it, as long as the assumption is true that you've set the ""what,"" and now the person who has to execute has everything they need to do the ""how."" But rarely is that actually true, because either authorities are fragmented, or they don't actually have the skills or the capabilities or the money. They're going to need other parts of the organization to help them, which really means, because of the way the organization is set up, just asking your subordinates to execute what you need to do. ""You figure out how to do it."" I think that's a great leadership maxim. They need to go figure that out, but you've got to help them and support them as they do it. It can't just be a fire-and-forget sort of weapon.

Francis Rose: Are there best practices to providing that support? Or does it depend on what each individual change project involves?

Kirk Rieckhoff: I think the answer is yes. One common way of doing it is to burn the boat, meaning you've said where we need to get going: make it so we can't go backwards. The common way to do this is to change the funding levels, right? ""We are going to become more productive, or I'm going to reduce the funding."" That is a way of burning the boat. But if you don't get into that in making sure the change happens, of course, it just hollows things out. I think it's a good way of making it so you can't backtrack, but it has to be done carefully; otherwise you'll get weird second-order effects that'll actually be super detrimental, but they won't show up for three or four years.

I think the next best practice to consider here--how to support folks as they're doing this--is setting up the regular cadence of a dialogue with them. ""Hey, what is the progress we're making?"" Ask them to make it about the issues that they're facing.

""How are we doing on progress? What are the issues?"" Help them work through, ""What do you need from me?"" I think you see that oftentimes, a common leadership technique of, ""Here are my priorities I'm going to need every month. How are we doing on progress?"" But it's less an update, and much more of a dialogue about, ""What do you need to keep going faster and to keep making progress?""

Francis Rose: What keeps those communication pathways--whether they're meetings or whatever--what keeps them productive rather than being eye-rollers for the people who are invited or required to attend?

Kirk Rieckhoff: Oh, for sure, right? How many of us have sat through those meetings where it's a dog and pony show where whoever's the best briefer wins? To keep those things alive, first I would recommend [asking], ""How do you tie that change effort into the core part of the mission of what you're trying to get done, so that the connection there is quite clear?""

The second thing to do is to understand what's the information source to help us know where we are? In the private sector, it's so much easier because at the end of the day, you have a very clear scoreboard around top-line revenue versus bottom-line cost. It's so much easier that way. But you've got to figure out the same ""what."" That's where performance management comes into play. And it should be set up by somebody who is independent from the organization that's doing the change.

It doesn't necessarily have to be like the GAO [Government Accountability Office], for example. But it does need to be somebody, ideally, that other people in the organization you're reviewing really do respect. I came from the Air Force, and I would say the people who did the best job of that as independent folks were what we called the ""patch wearers"" as pilots. They were the best of the best. They were trying to help us get better, but they also could really see where we were at.

Who are those folks? It's quite a different thing than an IG [inspector general], where the question is, ""Does the organization really respect who is in the IG? And what are the incentives there?"" I would actually consider figuring out the people who others look to the most as the highest performers, and having them play that role.

Francis Rose: Is making big change in government different than making big change in the private sector? Are there different steps? Are there different techniques? Are there different evaluators for success and so on? And if so, what are they, Kirk?

Kirk Rieckhoff: That's a really tough one. It changes because in the government, the metrics feel oftentimes like a lot of people are grasping for them, and they're never going to be good enough. I would just acknowledge that. The idea that you can manage by metrics, I think, is just craziness.

But if you use them as a tool to dig in to understand more, that's where gold happens. And my firm is as guilty of it as any. The stoplight charts with red, yellow, and green are the most dangerous things in a way, because it makes the metrics start looking like that's the grade, and we want everything to go green, instead of looking at it as, ""All right, hey, I'm seeing this one thing going down. Why is that? And let's solve that thing."" It just tells you where to look, not what the answer is.

Francis Rose: Last question. So you and I sit down for the first time. I'm bringing you in to help me manage whatever it is I'm trying to change in my organization. And I'm starting to build this strategy. I'm starting to fulfill this vision that you have of organizing for change, laying out tactics and all of that. What's the most common mistake that you've seen before that you want to make sure I don't do when I have a clean slate from which to work, Kirk?

Kirk Rieckhoff: The mistake that I wouldn't want you to miss, what I think will up your chances, is the choice you make on how you set up the change effort. If you're a senior leader, any effort you make is going to be a big effort.

I think there are only three different kinds of approaches you can use. Oftentimes we don't even know there are three options, and we just pick one. Typically, it's, ""Hey, I want to make a change happen, so I'm going to pick this person."" And you go get a team, and you make it happen.

I would actually be much more deliberate about that. I would think through [the questions], ""What's the kind of change I'm trying to make? And then what's the right approach for that change?"" There are three approaches that we've seen in McKinsey that work really well. They only work in the right context. One is the incubator model, which is where you take out this brand-new idea, and you give it its own authority, its own small organization, and you let it run.

It's a small thing. You almost have to protect it from the larger organization. And that's important, especially when you're trying to do self-disruptive things or things that the organization itself wouldn't naturally do. For example, trying to outsource things or commercialize things is a common version of this.

The second model is the pathfinder approach, which is the most common one that I see, where people in this become a little more standard practice: ""Hey, we know this is a good idea. We want to pilot it somewhere."" The trick, though, to this pathfinder approach is that you have to do two things with it.

One is, it can't be too big or too small. It has to be something that the top of the house cares about. It can't be so small that it doesn't really require change to happen. And if it's too small, you won't care. So make it a big enough thing, a pathfinder you really care about.

At the same time, whoever is running that organization needs to have people on their team who can, within their own model, make the changes that are necessary. They have all of the authorities and the expertise. That's also called an agile team. They can really make things happen on this pathfinder approach.

The last one is the transformation office. This oftentimes gets slapped on top of a change effort, without thinking through [the question], ""Why am I using this approach versus the others?"" Where I see it gets misused is that the transformation office inherently is trying to make change happen within the existing organizational model you have, which is great, as long as that's the organizational model that will work.

But if you're trying to do something that is anathema to the organization or disrupting it, it will never work. So you've just got to be careful. I find transformation offices are usually really good when you need the whole of the organization all moving toward something. But it's really already set up, so it's almost more of a driving continual progress.

Francis Rose: Kirk, we've covered a lot of ground in this conversation. And there are a lot more questions I'd like to ask, but we're out of time. I'm grateful for you joining me today. I appreciate it.

"38","Helping employees embrace change","Jennifer A LaClair , Ravi P Rao","November 1, 2002","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/helping-employees-embrace-change","6","When it comes to making big changes in an organization--implementing a Six Sigma program, optimizing business processes, adopting a new sales strategy--executives know that the wild card in the pack is their employees' capacity to adapt to a new order. Although the hoped-for benefits of a major initiative can shrink dramatically if employees misunderstand or resist it, success or failure depends as much on how the change is made as on the project itself. Fortunately, when companies attempt to change, a little improvement goes a long way.

To determine the role of people and process issues, we studied change programs at 40 organizations, including banks, hospitals, manufacturers, and utilities.1
Each of these projects was initiated by senior management, could potentially have had a large economic impact on the organization, and required major company-wide changes in behavior, tasks, and processes.

Two dimensions interested us. First, we gauged the difference between the expected value of a project (essentially calculated in the business case for it) and the value the company claimed to have achieved when it was completed. Second, we rated each company's strength in 12 widely recognized factors for managing change effectively, including the roles of senior and middle managers in the initiative as well as the company's project-management skills, training, and incentives for promoting change (Exhibit 1). These two dimensions made it possible for us to compare patterns in change-management strengths and weaknesses with realized returns in all 40 initiatives.

In all, 58 percent of the companies failed to meet their targets; 20 percent captured only a third or less of the value expected. The remaining 42 percent of these companies gained the expected returns or exceeded them--in some instances by as much as 200 to 300 percent.

Not surprisingly, perhaps, companies with the lowest returns also had poor change-management capabilities, and companies that gained big returns had strong ones (Exhibit 2).2
But we also found that strength on any one level of the organization--senior executives, middle managers, or frontline troops--gave companies a better chance of success. No single level was more critical in that respect than any other.

Companies that had problems on one or two levels of the organization nonetheless captured all or much of the expected returns of change initiatives (Exhibit 3). Seven companies were strong in two levels but had poor abilities in the other--for instance, a midsize regional bank was weak in frontline skills; an international computer hardware manufacturer, in middle-management authority. Yet these seven companies captured, on average, 129 percent of the expected value. In fact, nearly 70 percent of it was captured even by companies that had inadequate change-management capabilities on any two levels of the organization.

For the 11 most successful companies in our study, effective change management clicked at every level: senior and middle managers and frontline employees were all involved, responsibilities were clear, and the reasons for the change were understood throughout the organization. These 11 companies gained an average of 143 percent of the returns they expected. By contrast, in companies that fell short of expectations, we found a lack of commitment from or follow-through by senior executives, defective project-management skills among middle managers, and a lack of training for and confusion among frontline employees. Meanwhile, the 11 companies that had problems at all three levels captured, on average, only 35 percent of the value they expected.

Consider the experiences of two hospitals in our study. Each aimed to reduce its costs by creating an independent purchasing group. At one hospital, the CEO and the chief purchasing officer communicated their bold expectations for the initiative, and stakeholders (that is, physicians) at every level were involved throughout it. At the other hospital, the CEO didn't mandate the change and was described as ""invisible"" during implementation; other senior leaders were also largely silent; middle managers didn't know who made the calls; and frontline staff had no clear understanding of the new policies or of the reasons for complying with them. The first hospital exceeded its expectations for the initiative (125 percent of the business case) in less than a year, while the second gained barely half of the expected savings. Other factors contributed to the difference in realized expectations--everything from relations with suppliers to industry conditions. Yet if any single level of the organization of the second hospital had been better primed to implement the changes, it could have realized a better return on its change initiative.

Developing new strategies or operational initiatives is the most important way companies renew themselves, by helping to preserve their competitive advantage and stimulating platforms for long-term success. Preparing the company for a change by making any level of the organization better able to deal with it may be as important as the details of the project.

"39","Master data management: The key to getting more from your data","Aziz Shaikh , Holger Harreis , Jorge Machado , Kayvaun Rowshankish , Rajat Jain","May 15, 2024","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/mckinsey-digital/our-insights/master-data-management-the-key-to-getting-more-from-your-data","6","Picture this: a sales representative at a multibillion-dollar organization has an upcoming meeting with a prospective client. She searches for the client in the organization's customer relationship management software and finds several accounts with the same name. She struggles to learn more about the products and services the client is already buying, the customer contacts that have already been engaged, and the relationships the contact may have with other sales representatives within the organization. As a result, the sales representative spends several hours manually pulling together information to get organized for the upcoming meeting.

This scenario is an example of poor master data management (MDM), which commonly results in suboptimal customer and employee experience, higher costs, and lost revenue opportunities. MDM is a critical component of any organization's data strategy (see sidebar ""About master data management""). These capabilities can make or break an organization's efficiency and reliability--particularly in complex organizations with multiple business units, where data silos can lead to inefficiencies and errors.

In 2023, McKinsey surveyed more than 80 large global organizations1
across several industries to learn more about how they organize, use, and mature their master data. McKinsey's Master Data Management Survey indicated that organizations have four top objectives in maturing their MDM capabilities: improving customer experience and satisfaction, enhancing revenue growth by presenting better cross- and up-selling opportunities, increasing sales productivity, and streamlining reporting (Exhibit 1).

MDM plays an important role with modern data architecture concepts and creates value in five ways:

But many organizations have not fully harnessed the potential of MDM. This article builds on the insights from our MDM survey, describes the common challenges companies face when integrating MDM capabilities, and highlights areas in which MDM could be optimized to help businesses gain a competitive advantage.

Small and large organizations alike can benefit from implementing MDM models, yet collecting and aggregating quality data can be difficult because of funding constraints, insufficient technological support, and low-caliber data. Based on our survey results, following are some of the most prevalent challenges to implementing MDM.

Demonstrating potential savings through reduced data errors, enhanced operational efficiency, and improved decision making can provide a clear return on investment for MDM initiatives. However, this return is inherently difficult to quantify, so positioning MDM as a priority ahead of projects with more visible, immediate benefits can be challenging. Consequently, despite MDM's potential to enhance an organization, leaders may have a difficult time building a business case for augmenting their MDM and investing in associated architecture and technology capabilities.

Let's deliver on the promise of technology from strategy to scale.

Eighty percent of organizations responding to our survey reported that some of their divisions operate in silos, each with its own data management requirements, practices, source systems, and consumption behaviors. For example, a sales team may maintain client data in a customer relationship management (CRM) system, while a marketing team may use a client data platform (CDP) to create customer profiles and inform ad campaigns. Silos can lead to inconsistencies and errors, increasing the difficulty of making decisions related to business, data, and technology (see sidebar ""Types of master data domains"").

Organizations typically think of MDM as a technology discipline rather than as a differentiator that can drive enterprise value. According to our survey, only 16 percent of MDM programs are funded as organization-wide strategic programs, leaving IT or tech functions to carry the financial responsibility (Exhibit 2). Sixty-two percent of respondents reported that their organizations had no well-defined process for integrating new and existing data sources, which may hinder the effectiveness of MDM.

While technology plays a crucial role, the success of MDM initiatives requires significant business influence and sponsorship to set the strategic direction, understand data dependencies, improve the quality of data, enhance business processes, and, ultimately, support the organization in achieving its goals. It's important for the role of data owner to be played by a business stakeholder--specifically, the head of the business unit that uses the data most, such as the head of sales and marketing for the client data domain. That leader can provide guidance for defining data requirements and data quality rules that are aligned with the business's goals.

Poor-quality data cannot deliver analytics-based insights without substantial manual adjustment. According to the MDM survey, 82 percent of respondents spent one or more days per week resolving master data quality issues, and 66 percent used manual review to assess, monitor, and manage the quality of their master data. Consequently, large, multidivisional organizations may be unable to efficiently generate KPIs or other metrics, and sales representatives may be unable to quickly generate a consistent, holistic view of prospective clients. According to the MDM survey, the most prevalent issues in organizations' data quality were incompleteness, inconsistency, and inaccuracy (Exhibit 3).

In addition to incompleteness, inconsistency, and accuracy, many companies also contend with issues of uniqueness, or duplicate information, across systems. Traditionally, organizations classify data assets based on the stakeholders they interact with, but this approach can lead to duplication of information. For example, a supplier to an organization can also be its customer. These circumstances have led to the design of a ""party"" data domain that generalizes the characteristics of a person or organization and establishes the connection between them and their distinctive roles to the company.

Master data quality issues can cause customer dissatisfaction, operational inefficiencies, and poor decision making. Furthermore, companies handling private or sensitive consumer information have stricter compliance requirements and data quality, security, and privacy standards. Without good data, implementing MDM processes will be difficult.

Organizations may find it difficult to integrate MDM into their existing systems. Compatibility issues, data migration challenges, and system upgrades can hinder successful MDM implementation, and minimizing integration latency is crucial to provide timely and accurate data to the MDM system. Organizations may have to significantly model, map, and transform data systems so they can work with newer and older technologies.

To overcome these challenges and successfully implement and optimize MDM capabilities, organizations must clearly identify the value they hope to create based on their priority business use cases such as operational efficiency and customer insights, which lead to cost savings and revenue growth. Organizations should measure the impact and effectiveness of MDM implementation using metrics such as ROI, total cost of ownership, and performance baselines. Organizations should maintain a forward-looking approach to adopt modern tools and technologies; create a robust data governance model backed by performance KPIs; and plan for capability building among stakeholders to ensure a uniform adoption of MDM principles.

An MDM ""golden record"" is a repository that holds the most accurate information available in the organization's data ecosystem. For example, a golden record of client data is a single, trusted source of truth that can be used by marketing and sales representatives to analyze customer preferences, trends, and behaviors; improve customer segmentation; offer personalized products and services; and increase cross-sales, interactions, customer experiences, and retention.

To build a golden record that contains the most up-to-date information, organizations integrate data from every business unit into the golden record and update it as more accurate information becomes available. Integrating information can be done with the help of AI and machine learning (ML) technology. Alternatively, organizations may establish one existing system as the golden record for a specific data domain to maintain consistency, precision, and timeliness across the enterprise.

There are four common MDM design approaches that can be used to update the golden record within the business unit data (see sidebar ""Four common master data management design approaches""). Deploying a modular architecture enables fit-for-purpose consumption and integration patterns with various systems to manage the golden record. For example, every mastered client record could be linked back to the source systems and mapped to a hierarchy to show association in the MDM system. Alternatively, client data could be mastered and assigned a unique client ID within the golden record to stitch together data from all systems and create a single portfolio of a client.

Only 29 percent of companies responding to our survey had full upstream and downstream MDM integrations with source systems and business applications, as well as all governance or stewardship roles, in place. Organizations should clearly identify the single source of truth for data and properly train employees on handling integration failures to avoid saving stale information.

Data governance models for MDM should be designed with clear roles and responsibilities, be managed by a governance council with representatives from different business units and IT, and be shepherded by someone who can serve as an MDM liaison among business, data, and technology stakeholders. The structure should be complemented by a clearly defined policy framework and a tailored, business-backed, and IT-supported operating model for master data domains. These data governance processes will allow upstream system owners and a data governance council to address data quality issues--for example, when the MDM identifies new or updated information as conflicting with other information based on the survivorship strategy.

MDM tools are becoming more intuitive and user-friendly, and recent innovations in AI, ML, cloud technologies, and federated architectures have opened new possibilities for data mastering and processing. For example, AI-enabled tools use pretrained AI and ML models to automate data quality, data matching, and entity resolution tasks with a higher degree of accuracy and greater efficiency. According to the survey, 69 percent of organizations are already using AI as part of their overall data management capabilities; however, only 31 percent are using advanced AI-based techniques to enhance match-and-merge capabilities and to improve master data quality more broadly.

Organizations should choose data management tools that align with their priorities and make the transition seamless. It's also important to consider the return on investment and the incremental value that each MDM tool can bring to the organization. When choosing an MDM tool, relevant business stakeholders should understand data processes and requirements, including the data elements that affect business operations and the priority use cases, and then help determine the technology capabilities and workflows that are required to integrate new systems.

For example, stakeholders should assess the maturity of their organization's capabilities, including its data quality, matching, and entity resolution, to determine how easily new systems will be able to integrate with existing systems and technologies. It is also important to consider these systems' scalability and flexibility to accommodate future growth and evolving data management needs. Moreover, AI and ML capabilities should be considered to help the MDM tool automate tasks to improve data quality.

Organizations that implement technology without changing their processes and the way people work with master data may not fully reap the benefits of MDM.

Change management is crucial to ensure that employees understand and embrace the changes brought about by MDM implementation. It typically includes securing executive sponsorship to demonstrate the importance of MDM to the organization; engaging with business and technology stakeholders to communicate the vision; setting expectations for accountability and processes; and rolling out comprehensive training programs to educate employees on MDM and data principles, processes, and tools.

Organizations can start integrating MDM tools by first piloting MDM in one domain to validate its design, governance model, and workflows in a controlled environment. Organizations can then easily identify any potential issues or challenges and make the necessary adjustments before scaling up the implementation to other master data domains or to the entire organization. Piloting these tools also allows organizations to gather feedback from users and stakeholders to understand the user experience, identify areas for improvement, and make necessary changes to optimize the MDM tool and workflows.

Implementing and optimizing MDM capabilities can seem daunting, especially for large organizations with multiple complex systems. But once successfully deployed across master data domains--using an optimal design approach, an efficient governance structure, and sufficient change management efforts--MDM can ensure that high-quality data is available for strategic decision making, leading to cost savings and revenue opportunities across an organization.

"41","Tornando a mudança uma questão pessoal","Scott Keller , Bill Schaninger","August 21, 2019","https://www.mckinsey.com/capabilities/people-and-organizational-performance/our-insights/getting-personal-about-change/pt-br","6","Um jeito certeiro de dar um tiro no pé ao realizar um esforço de transformação de grande porte é ignorar o que se passa na cabeça de seus funcionários. Em uma pesquisa conduzida para o livro que publicamos recentemente - Beyond Performance 2.0 (John Wiley & Sons, julho de 2019) - observamos que nenhum executivo que trabalhava em empresas (total de zero empresas na pesquisa) que desconsideravam análises sobre a mentalidade dos funcionários durante o programa de transformação avaliou o esforço como sendo ""extremamente bem-sucedido"". Por outro lado, os executivos de empresas que dedicaram tempo e esforço para lidar com as mentalidades existentes tinham quatro vezes mais probabilidade de avaliar os programas de transformação como tendo algum nível de ""sucesso"" do que aqueles que trabalhavam em organizações que não o faziam.

Esses números refletem o poder das mudanças de mentalidade. Em sistemas humanos, elas ajudam a obter o mesmo efeito da transformação de uma lagarta em borboleta, ou de um girino em um sapo: quando os funcionários se abrem para novas formas de ver as possibilidades existentes para elas e para suas organizações, deixa de ser possível retornar ao estado anterior em que não havia tal perspectiva mais ampla, assim como borboletas e sapos não são mais capazes de reverter a suas formas físicas anteriores. Para conseguir concretizar tal metamorfose, os líderes devem primeiro identificar as mentalidades limitantes para reformatá-las adequadamente e, finalmente, certificarem-se de que os funcionários não revertam às formas antigas de comportamento. Neste artigo, apresentamos aos leitores o processo necessário para mudar mentalidades, com ênfase especial no estágio final e no porquê de ele ser tão importante e difícil.

A história da Manchester Shoe Company, contada por Benjamin Zander em seu livro The Art of Possibility, mostra de forma clara a importância de uma mentalidade positiva. No início do século passado, nos anos de 1900, inspirada por um desejo de entrar em um mercado geograficamente distante, a empresa enviou dois caixeiros viajantes para avaliar a região. Alguns dias depois, dois telegramas chegaram separadamente. Um dizia ""Situação terrível. Eles não usam sapatos!"", enquanto no outro lia-se ""Oportunidade maravilhosa: eles ainda não usam sapatos!"". Imagine o que teria acontecido se a empresa tivesse agido somente em função da primeira mensagem.

Agora, considere a fábula sobre gestão contada por Gary Hamel e C. K. Prahalad: quatro macacos sentados em uma jaula olham fixamente para um cacho de bananas, acessível somente por degraus que pendem do teto. Sempre que os macacos tentam subir os degraus para pegar as bananas, um jato de água fria bloqueia sua passagem. Após alguns dias, ao se darem conta de que não fazia sentido tentar chegar até os ""frutos proibidos"", eles naturalmente desistiram. Então, alguns dos humanos que estavam na sala retiraram a mangueira de água que causava o jato e, ao mesmo tempo, substituíram um dos macacos originais por outro. Ao ver as bananas, o novo macaco começa a subir os degraus, mas seus companheiros - por serem seres sociais - puxam o macaco para trás antes que ele recebesse o jato de água. O novo macaco fica espantado, olha em volta e tenta repetidamente subir a escada, sendo todas as vezes puxado de volta pelos demais. Finalmente, o novo macaco aceita o código de conduta do grupo e não tenta mais ir pegar as bananas.

Nas semanas seguintes, as pessoas observando o teste começaram a retirar os macacos originais, um de cada vez, e os substituíram por novos macacos que nunca tinham visto o jato de água. Ao final da experiência, com bananas maravilhosas e maduras, bem colocadas na plataforma acima da jaula, e macacos que nunca tinham vivenciado o jato de água, nenhum dos animais tentou subir os degraus para pegar as frutas. Todos eles tinham aprendido a regra não explícita: ""neste lugar, não se pega bananas"".

Hamel e Prahalad criaram essa história não como forma de representar uma descoberta real do campo da primatologia, mas sim como uma maneira forte e memorável de demonstrar uma verdade mais ampla sobre a vida corporativa - mais especificamente, que mentalidades introjetadas por práticas de gestão passadas permanecem válidas muito tempo depois da existência efetiva das práticas que as moldaram, mesmo depois de já terem sido instauradas novas práticas de gestão.

Aqui temos três exemplos do campo de negócios que salientam os perigos de se ignorar essa lição. Exemplo 1: um banco, ao identificar como os funcionários de mais alto desempenho eram bem-sucedidos em fazer vendas casadas, decidiu implementar um programa de transformação com o suporte de um bom questionário para definição de perfis e roteiros que pudessem ser utilizados pelos demais funcionários - e ficou chocado ao constatar que tais iniciativas tinham tido um impacto ínfimo nas vendas. Exemplo 2: uma empresa de telecomunicações introduziu um processo e um sistema de classificação extremamente simplificados para avaliações de desempenho e, mesmo assim, observou que os liderem continuavam evitando dar mensagens difíceis. Finalmente, exemplo 3: um fabricante investiu centenas de milhões em uma plataforma tecnológica de gestão de conhecimento para desestimular o acúmulo individual de informações e incentivar a colaboração - mas, muitos meses depois, teve de declarar que o tal sistema tinha sido um fracasso completo.

Em todos esses exemplos, as empresas fizeram um bom trabalho de reconhecimento quanto à mudança de comportamento necessária para se obter os objetivos desejados. No entanto, não investiram tempo nem utilizaram as ferramentas disponíveis para entender porque funcionários inteligentes, trabalhadores e bem-intencionados continuavam a se comportar do mesmo modo que sempre se comportaram (ver quadro lateral ""Desvendando mentalidades inconscientes"").

A principal ferramenta para desvendar mentalidades inconscientes é uma técnica de entrevista chamada de laddering (ou entrevista em escada), baseada na teoria de mudança pessoal criada por Dennis Hinkle em 1965. Esta técnica utiliza atividades como role play, perguntas hipotéticas, provocação de participantes, contação de histórias e relações entre o que foi dito em diferentes momentos do tempo. Tais esforços levam as pessoas a refletir sobre seus motivos mais profundos e, ao final, trazem à tona os valores e as premissas que utilizam para construir seu mundo pessoal.

Embora a técnica de laddering seja bastante ponderosa, ela tem uma limitação clara: é difícil utilizá-la em escala em uma organização de grande porte e bastante diversa. Uma técnica complementar, que permite apreender de forma mais profunda e abrangente o que ocorre sob a superfície, utiliza grupos focais e estímulos visuais. Nessa abordagem,  em torno de 100 imagens são colocadas sobre a mesa e os participantes devem escolher aquelas que representam de forma mais adequada seus sentimentos em relação a um dado tópico - por exemplo, ""o que mais estimula ou frustra você em relação a esta empresa""; ""qual a sua maior esperança em relação a esta empresa""; ""qual destas imagens representa a venda aos consumidores""; ""qual destas imagens representa o que você sente em uma avaliação de desempenho"";  ""qual destas imagens representa a forma de colaboração e compartilhamento de conhecimento aqui"". As imagens conduzem as pessoas a terem uma conversa mais honesta, emotiva e visceral do que perguntas mais diretas, do tipo ""me fale sobre..."".

A terceira ferramenta para compreender de forma mais abrangente as mentalidades corporativas vem de uma metodologia das ciências sociais chamada de análise de dados qualitativos (QDA, na sigla em inglês). Esta técnica minera fontes ricas em dados textuais (tais como relatórios, sites, propagandas, comunicações internas e cobertura da imprensa) e utiliza técnicas linguísticas (narrativas, modelos e análise de discurso) para identificar temas recorrentes, buscando causalidades. O uso de nuvens de palavras é um método básico e direto de análise de dados qualitativos com o qual as pessoas estão mais familiarizadas.

No banco, por exemplo, duas mentalidades aparentemente adequadas, mas que se mostraram limitadoras de desempenho no final, foram responsáveis pelo fracasso do treinamento e das novas ferramentas de estímulo às vendas. A primeira delas foi ""meu trabalho consiste em dar aos clientes o que eles querem""; a segunda, ""devo seguir a 'regra de ouro' e tratar meus clientes como gostaria de ser tratado"". Na empresa de telecomunicações, os funcionários tinham a crença arraigada, e que soava razoável, de que ""críticas prejudicam as relações"". Na fábrica, as pessoas tinham a convicção subjacente de que "" aqui, informação é poder, e os bons líderes são os líderes poderosos"".

O resultado? Ao analisar - e reagir - somente ao comportamento observável, os líderes dessas empresas deixaram passar a causa-raiz por trás dos comportamentos. Com isso, os esforços de mudança nas três organizações apresentaram resultados frustrantes.

Uma vez identificadas a causa-raiz das mentalidades existentes, o próximo passo é reformular essas crenças e, assim, expandir a variedade das escolhas comportamentais razoáveis que os funcionários fazem todos os dias. Isso cria o efeito da transformação de lagarta à borboleta mencionado anteriormente. Por exemplo, será que crenças distintas teriam servido de inspiração para escolhas comportamentais mais bem informadas e expansivas por parte dos bancários de desempenho mediano? Se sim, que crenças seriam estas? Digamos que eles acreditassem que seu trabalho - de fato, aquilo que faria com que eles agregassem valor para os demais - fosse ""ajudar os clientes a entender suas necessidades reais"" em vez de ""dar aos clientes o que eles querem"". Ou, ainda, que em vez de aplicar a 'regra de ouro' eles aplicassem a 'regra de platina' - ""tratar os outros como eles (e não os bancários) querem ser tratados"".

E o que ocorreria se os executivos da empresa de telecomunicações, em suas discussões sobre gestão de desempenho, acreditassem que ""honestidade, associada a respeito, não prejudica as relações; ao contrário, é algo essencial para construir relações mais fortes""? E se os gerentes da fábrica acreditassem que ""compartilhar informação, ao invés de acumulá-la individualmente, fosse a melhor forma de ampliar seu poder""? Se eles acreditassem nisso, é bem provável que a empresa não precisasse de um sistema de gestão de conhecimento extremamente caro (e, no final, inútil) para ajudar os funcionários a entrarem em contato uns com os outros e compartilharem as melhores práticas.

É importante observar que, por trás de cada uma das reformulações descritas acima, há uma mudança profunda na visão de mundo. Por exemplo, sair de uma mentalidade de dar aos clientes o que eles querem para uma mentalidade de ajudá-los a entender o que eles realmente precisam reflete uma mudança de posicionamento - de subordinado a colega. Reconhecer que a honestidade constrói - em vez de destruir - relacionamentos reflete uma passagem de vítima a mestre. E escolher acreditar que o poder é expandido ao se compartilhar informações, e que acumular informações individualmente não é sinal de força, desloca o foco da escassez para a abundância.

Os melhores exemplos de reformulação e nomeação são não somente profundos (utilizando termos práticos e relacionáveis, que refletem essas mudanças mais profundas em termos de visão de mundo), mas também repletos de insights (fazendo a passagem do inconsciente para o consciente, de forma a expandir as possibilidades), memoráveis (possibilitando que as coisas sejam facilmente mencionadas e discutidas no trabalho do dia a dia) e significativos (específicos da organização e com os quais as pessoas possam se identificar facilmente - ""isto é bem nosso jeito!"").

Dessa maneira, um varejista viu que era vital mudar de uma atitude de ""ouvir e reagir"" (uma mentalidade reativa) para a de ""antecipar e definir"" (uma mentalidade proativa). Já uma empresa de engenharia que queria melhorar a sua forma de capturar ideias externas percebeu que era consistentemente otimista demais sobre seus resultados, subestimando a concorrência. A empresa entendeu que tal atitude era derivada de uma mentalidade do tipo ""vencer significa não ter colegas"" (mentalidade de especialista), o que levava a um comportamento cada vez mais insular. Mudar para uma mentalidade de aprendizado--""vencer significa aprender mais e mais rápido do que os demais""--levou os funcionários a buscar as melhores práticas nos concorrentes e em outras áreas.

Analogias sobre saúde humana reforçam a mensagem de exemplos de negócios. Pense no dilema das pessoas com doenças coronarianas. Anos de pesquisa mostram que a maior parte dos pacientes cardíacos vive muito mais tempo se parar de fumar e beber, comer menos alimentos gordurosos, reduzir seu nível de estresse e fizer exercícios regularmente. De fato, muitos pacientes fazem um grande esforço nesse sentido. Ainda assim, praticamente todos os estudos mostram que 90% das pessoas que passaram por cirurgia cardíaca revertem ao seu comportamento anterior, pouco saudável, em mais ou menos dois anos.

Dean Ornish, professor de Medicina na Universidade da Califórnia em São Francisco e fundador do Preventive Medicine Research Institute, decidiu reformular a mentalidade subjacente por trás das narrativas dos pacientes. Ele queria mudar da atitude de ""se eu me comportar desta forma, não vou morrer"" (alavancada pelo medo) para a atitude de ""se eu me comportar desta forma, minha vida será alegre e feliz"" (alavancada pela esperança). Segundo ele, ""falar para pessoas solitárias e deprimidas que elas viverão por mais tempo se pararem de fumar ou mudarem sua dieta e estilo de vida não é tão motivador assim. Quem quer viver mais quando está em um estado de dor emocional crônica? Elas se sentiriam muito melhor se pudessem desfrutar dos prazeres do dia a dia sem ter qualquer dor ou desconforto"". Ele testou isso, e o resultado foi que 77% de seus pacientes conseguiram fazer mudanças permanentes em seu estilo de vida, em comparação a uma taxa normal de sucesso de 10%.

Reformular a causa-raiz das mentalidades que impede a mudança é um passo fundamental na direção certa e, às vezes, pode por si só levar à mudança comportamental desejada. No caso do banco citado anteriormente, por exemplo, quando os funcionários foram expostos à 'regra de platina', eles imediatamente perceberam como seria mais produtivo segui-la. Eles simplesmente nunca tinham considerado o impacto que a forma dos bancários agirem tinha nos clientes.

No entanto, é bastante frequente que os funcionários tenham dificuldade de mudar seu comportamento por razões mais emocionais do que intelectuais. Afinal, a principal barreira para uma rápida mudança pessoal é nossa propensão, enquanto líderes, de dizer ""sim, este é o problema e a mudança de que precisamos. Seria ótimo se os outros mudassem sua forma de pensar e agir, pois avançaríamos muito mais"".

Em uma empresa que conhecemos, foi pedido que os líderes estimassem quanto tempo gastavam cuidando dos egos das outras pessoas - fazendo as pessoas sentirem como se ""minha ideia fosse sua"", por exemplo, ou cuidando para não invadir o espaço alheio. A maior parte estimou o tempo gasto em 20% a 30%. Em seguida, eles deveriam estimar quanto tempo gastavam cuidando de seus próprios egos. A maior parte deles ficou em silêncio. A psicologia chama esta dinâmica bastante previsível e humana de ""viés de autoconveniência"". Ele envolve encarar nossas próprias ações favoravelmente e interpretar eventos com uma ótica que nos beneficia. Isso explica porque 25% dos estudantes se coloca dentre o 1% mais capaz em termos de habilidade de se relacionar com os demais. Da mesma forma, esse viés também explica porque os casais, ao terem de estimar sua contribuição individual para as tarefas domésticas, geralmente acabam chegando a um número superior a 100%.

Em muitas áreas relacionadas a comportamentos, os seres humanos superestimam consistentemente o quanto somos parte da solução, e não do problema - e no caso de servir de exemplo de mudança, isto também ocorre. Em média, quando os líderes são questionados se ""eles servem de exemplo para as mudanças comportamentais desejadas"", 86% deles declaram que sim. Quando a mesma pergunta é feita para as pessoas que se reportam a esses líderes, a média de respostas positivas cai para apenas 53%.

Então, qual a melhor forma de superar esse viés e ajudar líderes e funcionários a se comprometerem a mudar seu próprio comportamento? Nossa experiência nos leva a crer fortemente que a intervenção mais adequada para isso é a realização de jornadas de aprendizado via workshops off-site com pequenos grupos de 20 a 30 funcionários. Geralmente, essas sessões de trabalho presenciais ocorrem durante dois dias e são lideradas por facilitadores experientes, versados nos princípios que norteiam o aprendizado de adultos e nas técnicas desenvolvidas no campo do potencial humano. A metodologia do workshop é centrada na Teoria U - uma tecnologia social desenvolvida durante a parceria de uma década entre Generon International, Otto Scharmer e Peter Senge, do Massachusetts Institute of Technology, e a Society for Organizational Learning. O processo da Teoria U possui três fases:

Sensing. Isto geralmente envolve um líder sênior que já tenha passado pelo workshop e que compartilha a história de mudança da empresa, descreve sua própria jornada pessoal de mudança e responde às perguntas dos participantes.

Presencing. Isto envolve a exploração, por parte dos participantes, de seu próprio ""iceberg"" comportamental. Esta fase inclui trabalhar com conteúdo e questões modulares, baseadas em discussões, que preparam os líderes para atingirem novos níveis de autoconsciência e autocontrole. Quanto e por que eu ajo com base em medo em vez de esperança? Escassez em vez de abundância? Vitimização em vez de maestria? E qual seria o resultado se fizesse escolhas distintas?

Realizing. Nesta fase, os participantes fazem escolhas explícitas e públicas com relação a mudanças de comportamento e mentalidade pessoais; identificam ""práticas de sustentação"" que vão ajudá-los a atuar com base em seus insights; e refletem sobre como irão engajar suas redes pessoais para os desafios e o suporte de que necessitarão durante o restante de suas jornadas pessoais de mudança.

Depois desses workshops, normalmente os pequenos grupos se encontram para dar aos colegas aconselhamento e sentido de responsabilidade. Depois de algumas semanas, há mais uma sessão com os facilitadores para fazer um balanço das mudanças comportamentais efetivadas.

Sabemos que essa abordagem pode soar excessivamente ""subjetiva"" para algumas pessoas. Mas o fato é que observamos o impacto transformacional que ela gera nas pessoas - de engenheiros holandeses e banqueiros norte-americanos a oficiais de governos do Oriente Médio e funcionários de conglomerados sul-coreanos. Embora algumas organizações coloquem todos os seus funcionários para participar desses workshops, é possível obter a maior parcela do impacto por meio de uma massa crítica de líderes de pessoas - o que o campo da epidemiologia mostrou normalmente ser formada por 25% a 30% do total de funcionários. Nesses casos, todos os líderes acabam por deixar de lado a mentalidade de ""seria ótimo se eles mudassem"" e passam a ter um sentimento profundo de que ""para que isso aconteça, eu tenho que mudar"".

Nem todos os programas de mudança bem-sucedidos que conhecemos empregam essas técnicas; em nossa experiência, entretanto, todos os programas de mudança que as utilizaram (no contexto de outras intervenções recomendadas) deram certo, e em prazos bem mais curtos do que os esperados pela maioria dos líderes. O efeito pode ser particularmente positivo quando as organizações lidam com a questão de como atacar a ""parte congelada do meio"" - a camada de gerentes de nível médio resistentes à mudança.

Victor Frankl era um sobrevivente de Auschwitz cujo livro fundamental - Em busca de Sentido - há muito desafia e inspira leitores de diferentes disciplinas acadêmicas e profissionais. De forma bastante eloquente, ele sintetizou tudo o que é necessário para conseguir uma mudança pessoal do tipo da lagarta à borboleta: ""Entre estímulo e resposta, há um espaço. Neste espaço, está nosso poder de escolher nossa reação."" Achamos útil usar uma versão abreviada da ideia de Frankl: S (estímulo) + T (como você escolhe pensar sobre o estímulo) = R (resposta).

O S nessa equação é vital para que o trabalho mencionado anteriormente no T possa efetivamente vingar: afinal, como a história dos macacos ilustra bem, o ambiente de trabalho é capaz de moldar de forma contundente as mentalidades e os comportamentos dos funcionários, ainda que demore um certo tempo.

Ainda assim, se os funcionários saem dos workshops comprometidos a mudar, mas retornam ao mesmo ambiente de trabalho que se entranhou em suas mentalidades originais, é bem menos provável que as novas mentalidades se tornem realmente pessoais - ou permanentes.

Para servir de analogia, imagine que no sábado você vá assistir a uma ópera e no domingo a um evento esportivo. No clímax da ópera, na melhor parte, você fica sentado em silêncio e total concentração; em seguida, você e o restante da audiência aplaudem educadamente. No clímax do evento esportivo, também na melhor parte, você levanta, grita e pula sem parar. Você não mudou - ainda é a mesma pessoa, com os mesmos sentimentos, valores e necessidades. Mas seu contexto mudou e, portanto, também mudou sua mentalidade quanto ao comportamento adequado para expressar contentamento e apreço - o comportamento que você escolheu e as práticas que você optou por mostrar.

Quando se considera mudar o estímulo (o S)--o ambiente de trabalho--ao qual os funcionários estão expostos, observamos que as quatro alavancas do ""modelo de influência"" da McKinsey serve de guia bastante prático e de eficácia comprovada (quadro).1
Nossa pesquisa e experiência demonstram que mudanças na forma de pensar e se comportar serão significativas e sustentadas se os líderes e os funcionários virem comunicações e rituais claros (a alavanca de entendimento e convicção); se existirem incentivos, estruturas, processos e sistemas de suporte (a alavanca de mecanismos formais); se oportunidades de desenvolvimento e treinamento forem combinadas a decisões sólidas sobre talentos (a alavanca de confiança e habilidades); e se os líderes de influência e os líderes seniores 2
permitirem que os outros tomem por modelo o próprio comportamento dos líderes (a alavanca de role-modeling).

Muitos líderes se perguntam quais das quatro alavancas é a mais importante. As evidências mostram que todas importam, com pequenas variações estatísticas em termos de grau, e que as pessoas não precisam vivenciá-las em nenhuma ordem específica - a chave está em garantir que todas se tornem experiências consistentes. Comunicar aos funcionários que você quer que eles adotem mentalidades, práticas e comportamentos exibidos em um estádio de esportes não vai adiantar se seus sistemas de avaliação - e as ações da liderança que são observadas pelos funcionários - forem aquelas exibidas na ópera. Se você quiser que as pessoas pensem como torcedores esportivos, você precisa criar um ambiente de estádio que incentive e possibilite que eles pensem e ajam de maneira distinta.

Discutimos a importância e o valor do estímulo (o S) e da reflexão (o T) separadamente, mas na realidade ambos estão profundamente ligados. As mentalidades de uma pessoa (o T) motivam o seu comportamento (o R), que se torna a parte do role modeling do S para aqueles que interagem com esta pessoa--uma evidência da importância de começar as mudanças do T no topo da organização.

Não é por acaso que utilizamos diferentes histórias neste artigo. Contar histórias é um artifício poderoso: ela vai além dos fatos e dos números para estimular e moldar mentalidades. Pensar em termos de histórias também é um lembrete poderoso de que a mudança, em última instância, é algo pessoal, uma vez que toda história está aberta a significados e interpretações individuais. Na mesma linha, se você quer liderar a mudança, você deve abarcar tanto a dimensão contextual como a dimensão pessoal. Dominá-las é um desafio, mas é também extremamente recompensador - não somente para as organizações e as pessoas que você está tentando liderar, mas também para você como líder e como pessoa.

"43","How banks can boost productivity through simplification at scale","Akshay Kapoor , Asheet Mehta , Pradip Patiath , Vinod Surendran","March 13, 2025","https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/financial-services/our-insights/how-banks-can-boost-productivity-through-simplification-at-scale","6","Productivity, efficiency, and costs are never too far from bank executives' minds. In previous waves of efficiency drives, banks have succeeded in reducing costs, though the extent of these achievements has varied--from about 3 to 5 percent at most banks to as much as 10 percent for the most successful ones. However, most of these gains are short lived as other priorities and demands erode progress, leading costs to creep up again. Given macroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties, it behooves banks to keep a close eye on efficiency to achieve ROE of 10.0 percent or more and ROA of 1.5 percent or higher. Boosting efficiency has the additional benefit of creating surplus cash to invest in building capabilities in gen AI, tech modernization, data, cybersecurity, and more.

Two trends are complicating the picture:

For a bank, improving productivity means reducing the unit quantity of work required. This measurement and the related costs for banking products have increased for the past decade or so because of increased complexity and process inefficiencies. For example, the average cost to originate a mortgage has risen 8 percent a year, from about $5,100 in 2012 to about $11,600 in 2023.1
Beyond inflationary effects, this steady rise was driven by the increasing work that needs to go into a mortgage, including risk and compliance factors. Streamlining and simplifying the process will not only reduce costs for banks but also boost customer satisfaction by minimizing errors and accelerating processing times. Interestingly, the most efficient mortgage originators made mortgages at a cost of roughly $6,900 in 2023, about 60 percent of the average cost.

In this article, we first explore the challenges that have hindered banks from drastically improving productivity. Then, we dive into what needs to change for banks to achieve lasting productivity growth, which can also help enhance the customer experience.

Banks are acutely aware of their stubborn costs but often struggle to effectively mitigate them due to myriad challenges, including complex operating models, competing risk management initiatives, and patchworks of legacy systems and processes inherited from M&A deals. These competing priorities have forced banks to focus largely on near-term efficiency solutions, which don't address the core issues. Not surprisingly, banks find themselves perpetually treating symptoms rather than curing the underlying problems. Banks recognize that cost efficiency is critical, launching efficiency programs every two to three years, on average. However, these efforts typically fall short of transformative impact, often focusing on quick adjustments rather than on fundamentally reducing demand or simplifying the operating model.

The following are challenges to productivity and efficiency that banks face:

Since 2010, productivity at US banks has been falling 0.3 percent a year, on average, bucking productivity gains in most other sectors (Exhibit 2).

Improving productivity in banking is akin to climbing a mountain whose slope sharply steepens as one scales. The initial stages are gentle slopes, and classic cost-reduction approaches--such as optimizing the procurement process, managing travel and entertainment costs, and cutting spending on certain projects--can deliver results. But above a certain altitude, the challenges become more complex. The next stages warrant an integrative, multidomain approach that engages various tactical and strategic levers in tandem. This approach, which we call simplification at scale, results in higher productivity coupled with a better experience for clients and employees.

The kernel of the approach is rethinking the bank's operating model to drive down the unit cost of delivery. For each process or activity, the bank adopts an ROI mindset that considers the output produced per each unit of work completed. A key component is reducing or even eliminating customer demand that generates little profit or adds unnecessary operational complexity. Minimizing or eliminating demand at a granular level results in a substantive effect at the aggregate level, fundamentally and sustainably bending the cost curve.

In our experience, banks that take this comprehensive approach can achieve lasting productivity gains of up to 15 percent in two years, resulting in an ROE increase of 1.0 to 1.5 percentage points.

Next, we explore the twin components of the approach we've outlined, simplification and scale, in greater detail. Then, we break down the impact on productivity and experience.

This is the moment to ruthlessly apply Occam's razor, the principle that the simplest solution tends to be the best. To simplify, banks can scrutinize their business the way an investor would, calculating the ROI for various functions, processes, and segments. Simplification can involve the following themes:

Streamlining operations. Banks have successfully streamlined their portfolios by divesting themselves of assets, subsidiaries, or businesses that don't meet ROI thresholds and don't align with the overall strategic vision. Identifying these businesses involves assessing how core they are, how much it costs to run them, and how much risk they bring. Several regional banks have recently reduced their exposure to commercial real estate and shifted focus and investments toward digitalization and wealth management. And many banks have pulled back from trade finance and supply chain financing because these activities require a higher amount of regulatory capital.

For example, Citigroup streamlined its retail banking operations in recent years to focus on more lucrative areas such as wealth management, selling or winding down its retail banking and credit card businesses in countries including China, India, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Russia, South Korea, Thailand, and Vietnam.3
Citi delivered major improvements in 2024 compared with 2023, including revenue increases of 20 percent in wealth management and 15 percent in institutional services.4

As another example, HSBC is refocusing on its core regions, the United Kingdom and Hong Kong, and on wealthier clients across various markets.5
To do so, it has sold its consumer businesses in Canada, France, and the United States, and it is considering scaling back retail operations elsewhere. These moves are part of a strategic pullback from an earlier global expansion push.

Improving the operating model. Over time, complexity can creep into a bank's operations, making them slow, clogged, and opaque. Employees spend time and effort on tasks that not only fail to improve outcomes and outputs but, in many ways, hinder performance. For instance, our targeted calendar analysis of the banking sector found that 60 to 70 percent of employees' time (at the N-3 to N-7 levels, or three to seven levels below the top executive) was spent on internal discussions and updates, while just 30 to 40 percent was spent on client-facing or output-linked activities. This is very different from fintech and tech companies, where more than 80 percent of employees' time is spent on clear client-facing output. This dysfunction has crept into many departments within banks.

Banks can address a dysfunctional operating model through the following actions:

We have found that these types of changes can help banks improve productivity by 20 to 30 percent, without hiring more employees. But it is imperative to pursue a transformation that's comprehensive and brings lasting results. Less than a third of organizational transformations ended up improving performance and sustaining those improvements over time, according to a 2021 McKinsey survey.

To get started on the simplification effort, banks can consider a checklist of steps to help them make the most of the process (see sidebar, ""A primer for simplification in banking."")

Achieving the right scale is essential, especially in the challenging business environment banks face. To remain competitive, a bank must be strong as well as nimble, agile, and adaptive. Over time, regulatory requirements, compliance, technology, and risk management have added significant burdens. To handle these, institutions may choose to increase their scale to sustain the additional load.

While both simplification and scale are critical to success, the combination of the two creates a compounding effect that can deliver outsize impact. When these are aligned, bank executives have a clearer picture of where to focus resources, build capabilities, and double down on strengths, as well as where to pare back.

Banks can use metrics to evaluate performance at scale, such as the costs of originating and servicing loans. While ROA and ROE are good high-level metrics, banks also need a more granular view of these costs, along with drivers such as operational expenses, operations, technology, and risk at the subprocess level within the value chain.

The following are examples of how to achieve scale while keeping simplification in mind:

Entropy increases over time, with systems naturally drifting toward chaos unless corrected. How, then, has it been possible for US businesses in general to boost productivity while the banking sector has stagnated in this respect?

Improving productivity comes down to factors including technological advancements, globalization, skill enhancement, economic policies, broader consumption patterns, and process enhancements. The banking sector has benefited from these factors. Why, then, does the full potential of banking productivity remain elusive?

A large, complex system doesn't organically and naturally reinvent itself. Achieving reinvention requires deep, careful examination and preparation to simplify and reshape the system by first breaking it down into small components, then reassembling it in a more logical way and amplifying the impact of the transformation.

One inspirational example of this method is the transformation of British Cycling from underdogs to world champions through a simple but effective strategy championed by Dave Brailsford, the team's performance director until 2014: the aggregation of marginal gains.6
The strategy involves breaking down everything that goes into cycling into small bits, improving each of those bits by 1 percent, and gaining an outsize compound effect in performance. Big funding increases also helped.

Banks are large, complex ecosystems. Like Brailsford and his cyclists, banks can break down everything they do into tiny pieces to truly understand the unit quantity of work required to produce a given output, such as onboarding a client, issuing a mortgage or commercial loan, or servicing syndicated loans. This approach involves questioning, eliminating, and substituting inefficient processes to fundamentally reduce overall costs. Banks need to ask whether each unit of work across their operations is necessary and whether it can be simplified or eliminated. Then, they can remove unnecessary steps, replace inefficient processes with more efficient ones, and implement new processes or technologies that can improve efficiency.

For example, a payments business transformed its front and middle office by reviewing and revamping operations, removing friction, and building new and innovative capabilities, resulting in a $300 million revenue improvement and a 30 to 35 percent boost in productivity. A multinational bank, meanwhile, embarked on a focused transformation to redesign its payments operations to reduce errors and increase automation. Errors declined by 85 percent, while the bank's straight-through processing rate7
increased to 97 percent.

Banks can achieve significant simplification and cost reduction by harnessing technology, automation, data analytics, and streamlining of processes and policies. Changing mindsets, training, and upskilling can help bring employees on board, an integral piece of the simplification puzzle.

For example, encouraging customers to use self-service tools can lower volumes of calls and messages to contact centers, allowing banks to optimize footprints. Our experience shows that 70 to 80 percent of calls can be handled by automated systems, without being routed to human agents. Similarly, 60 to 70 percent of disputes between customers and merchants can be resolved without human interaction.

A bank's technology function is one of the hardest to simplify, as tech functions often suffer from cost overruns, time delays, and underdelivery on capabilities such as platform revamp and cloud migration. Bringing technology into the simplification fold involves adopting extremely tight scoping to clearly define project boundaries, implementing agile methodologies for testing and coding, and ensuring business integration to create a cohesive operation. In our experience, adopting these principles can lead to a 15 to 20 percent improvement in productivity.

Globally, banking is the single largest profit-generating sector, and banks play an integral part in keeping businesses and economies functioning smoothly. Despite the sector's centrality and impact, banks could do a lot more to improve the experience of their customers and employees. For example, a survey of residential mortgage customers found that banks lagged 20 to 30 percent behind nonbanks in overall satisfaction with the mortgage process.

Putting customers first can significantly move the needle, as many fintechs and select banks have shown. An excellent customer experience includes the following components, among others:

Given the banking system's complexity, banks will need to embrace tools and techniques to radically simplify and scale the resulting impact. We recognize, however, that simplification at scale is no panacea and the transformation must be tailored to each bank; otherwise, it's unlikely to work.

Context matters. For instance, a bank could choose to pursue simplification at scale to address a near-term target, to get ready for an M&A deal, or to work through an existing one that hasn't delivered the expected impact. The situation will inform whether the bank conducts an enterprise-wide refresh or something more targeted. No matter the context, the core principles of simplification remain the same: getting down to the unit quantity of work required and eliminating unnecessary tasks and processes.

Driving these changes can help banks deliver outsize, lasting impact, resulting in better productivity, a simpler operating model, and a positive customer and employee experience.

After surveying 5,000 product managers from around the world who work on both internal and external software products in a range of industries, some 75 percent responded that product management best practices aren't being adopted at their companies, that product management is a nascent function within their organization, or that it doesn't exist at all.

March 19, 2025When it comes to AI, employees around the world have a range of sentiments. Senior Partner Lareina Yee talks to Reid Hoffman of Greylock Partners about the four personas of AI sentiment that Reid introduces in his book Superagency: What Could Possibly Go Right with Our AI Future: Doomers, Gloomers, Bloomers, and Zoomers. While every group says they are familiar with gen AI, Yee notes that a McKinsey survey found that among respondents, Gloomers and Bloomers make up a similar share of the workplace, while Doomers are a clear minority.

March 18, 2025Shoppers continue to enjoy online shopping, but e-commerce growth in the United States is slowing down, and consumer preferences have changed over the past two years. What do today's online shoppers value most about package deliveries? It was delivery speed back in 2022, but that's now fallen to fifth place, note Partner Sandy Gosling and coauthors. In fact, a McKinsey survey found that 90 percent of customers are willing to wait at least two to three days for their deliveries if the shipping is free.
